"Where is the update of confusion matrix, prior, posterior prob?",khetan2/MBEM,2019-03-07 21:22:48,0,,1,418519014,"The two questions are somewhat related. 

1. In MBEM.py, there is one calculation of posterior prob before the start of MBEM algorithm. In ""core_train"" function it trains once, predicts, trains again with previous prediction as ground truth, and return the second prediction results. I couldn't find where the code updates the confusion matrix, prior and hence the posterior prob. Could you point me towards the piece of code? 

2. How does the code pass the posterior prob into the resnet for computing weighted loss? 

Thank you."
