2798,What are the simplest methods for the label noise problem?,khetan2/MBEM,2020-06-03 02:29:42,0,,3,629643438,"If I have enough low quality data from unsupervised methods or rule-based methods.

I read from https://github.com/subeeshvasu/Awesome-Learning-with-Label-Noise ,but these methods are a little complex for me.

In detail, I deal with a multi-label classification task. First I crawl web page such as wiki and use regex-based rule to mark the label. The model input is the wiki title and the model output is the rule-matched labels from wiki content. My task is to predict the labels for the wiki title.

Do you think **removing the wrong data predicted by trained model** is a simple but effective method?

@khetan2  Thank you very much!"
2799,Main function starts MBEM with trained resnet prediction?,khetan2/MBEM,2019-03-07 21:24:29,0,,2,418519656,"It is tripping to see the code actually starts the MBEM algorithm after training the resnet with weighted majority vote labels twice. Is this how the results are obtained?
