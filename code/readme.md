# Mine GitHub Issues
## The database:
There are 2 databases that are used in this project: 
1. `repoDB.csv`: Contains all repositories that are mined by [PaperWithCode API](https://api.paperwithcode.com/) under the following contains: 
    ```conference_ids = [_.lower() for _ in ["CVPR","ICLR","ICML","NeurIPS","ECCV","ICCV","AAAI","ACL","SIGKDD","CHI"]]```
    (Recommended by [The most important AI Conferences in 2022](https://www.am.ai/en/blog/ai-conferences-2022/).)

2. `issueDB.csv`: For every repository in `repoDB.csv`, we fetched all issues (both open issues and closed issues) under it. The mapping relationship between `issueDB.csv` and `repoDB.csv` are:

   **issue i in repo r** : `i[Name_Repo] == r[Name_Repo] & i[Identity_Repo] in r[IDList_Issue]`

   A cross check between these 2 DBs are conducted to ensure the integrity of them.
