"Thanks for sharing this repository, which is quite complete !    I am particularly interested in the multicut problem. If I am not wrong, there are 2 LP-based solvers:  -  . The corresponding files are `src/multicut/multicut_ _packing*`, e.g.  .  -  . The corresponding files are `src/multicut/multicut_message_passing*`, e.g.  .    On top of them, I wonder if there is another solver for multicut, whose the corresponding files are `multicut_ _text_input.*`, e.g.  . Is this right? If so, could you point me to its reference article ?    Moreover, the third solver has many parameters. I wonder how to call this method for a good performance. I suppose that you have already explored this aspect in some way. I saw the following call in the `mulitcut/eval` directory: `./multicut_odd_bicycle_wheel_text_input -i INPUT_FILE.txt -o OUTPUT_FILE.txt --standardReparametrization anisotropic --roundingReparametrization uniform:0.5 --tightenReparametrization uniform:0.5 --tightenInterval 50 --tightenIteration 1 --tightenConstraintsPercentage 0.05  --primalComputationStart 1 --primalComputationInterval 10 -v 2 --lowerBoundComputationInterval 10 --tighten`. Can we rely on this ?    By the way, is there any multicut ILP solver in this repository (based on the cutting plane approach)?    Thanks in advance.  "

"Hello, I want to ask the function of optical flow data.  In the literature, after input the pointcloud data into flownet3d, it can output the sceneflow. Therefore if we only need the pointcloud data to use the network, I don't understand why need to input optical flow data and gt data to get the sceneflow in training and evaluation? I think maybe it turns optical flow and gt into the correct sceneflow and makes the sceneflow as the label to train and test. Am I correct? If it is incorrect, what is the funtion of input optical flow and gt?    Thank you."

However, your preprocessed dataset here is without ground points, for which the EPE mentioned in the paper is 0.122, much lower (better) than the EPE you're getting with the KITTI evaluation script. Please help me resolve this discrepancy. Is it that the dataset is with ground points or is there an issue with the KITTI evaluation script?    Best Regards"

"Hello,     is there a way to download the trained model and use it without a GPU.   If yes, how can I do that?  Thanks in advance. "
"Dear Sir,    In the paper, it is mentioned that ""Our work  focuses on learning scene flow directly from point clouds, without any dependence on RGB images or assumptions on  rigidity and camera motions"". However, in the code for training using flying things 3D, you are clearly using RGB color information of point clouds to construct feature maps. Isn't that the same as using RGB images?

And the points are always the 2048 points first.     If you use the method of your paper for evaluation on KITTI, how can you make sure that you get all points for evaluation in frame one?  "
"Hi,  I downloaded your preprocessed Flyingthings3d dataset and when I run the evaluate command I get these unreasonable numbers for amost every batch:       Is there anything I'm doing wrong?"
"In the function __getitem__ in flying_things_dataset.py, the point clouds, stored in the cache,  are not randomly sampled with 2048 points and are returned with 8192 points. In this case, in the function get_batch in train.py, only first 2048 points of these point clouds will be used.    So I guess, there might exist an indentation problem between line47 and line65 in flying_things_dataset.py."
"Hi xingyul,    Thanks for the code and the pre-trained model.   I run the `evaluation.py` over the pre-trained model you provided but I got performance output below:       maybe it's an untrained model? or did I do it in the wrong way?    Best,  Zirui"

"@xingyul     I got your evaluation code , but how to visualize the flow in the paper you have shown. Kindly give some hints"
"Hi everyone,    I am very interested in this network and I have modified the scripts `command_evaluate.sh`, `evaluate.py` and `model_concat_upsa.py` in order to be able to do inference on point clouds of objects from `YCB` dataset.    Specifically, I changed the code in a way such that the point clouds of the two frames can have a different number of points as indicated in the paper. I tried again this code with the evaluation set from `FlyingThings3D`, that you provided, to verify that performance are unchanged.    However, when I try to feed the network with point clouds (xyz + colors in      Basically, the point clouds represent one of the faces of the box after it undergoes a small rotation. The rotation is such that the maximum change between points of the two frames is in the order of `~ 4cm` as shown in the figure.    When doing inference, the translation vectors from the frame on the left to the frame on the right are very strange and not compatible with that motion, something like       Do you think the point clouds I am feeding to the network are too different from the data from the `FlyingThings3D` dataset such that the network is not able to generalize with a model trained on that dataset?    Also, I saw that, within the model `model_concat_upsa.py`, several `radiuses` are defined, i.e.         plus some other hardcoded radius like `radius = 5.0`,  `radius = 2.4`, `radius = 1.2` and `radius = 0.6` in the definitions of the layers.    In your experience, are these values critical for the network? In case I need to the re-train the network with point clouds, optical flow and colors from scenes involving small objects, e.g. from `YCB` dataset, should I care in selecting them carefully or they are general enough?    Please find attached the point clouds (xyz + colors) of the two frames (files `frame0.txt` and `frame1.txt`) and the results of the inference (file `predicted_val.txt`) obtained using the pre-trained model available in this repository.    Thank you for your availability.                     "
"Hi,  Is there is any plan to relesae code relevaant to KITTI dataset?"
"Hi,    I am interested in this work and I would like to try it. It seems that on the repository an already trained model is not available. Are you planning to add it?    Thank you."
"Hi,  Excellent work! I have trained the model and obtained close results to the paper on FlyingThings3D dataset. I have some problems. 1). How to visualize the scene flow like your paper? 2).  When will the training and test on the KITTI dataset be released? And, can you provide the pre-trained model? Thank you very much!  Best,  Zhai"
"Hi, thank you for sharing your code. I generate my own dataset with points1 xyz and points2 xyz and gt flow, but without color1 and color2.

Q1：If i want to evaluate on awa2，should i still train on imagenet？
"Thank you very much for your contribution!  I have tested your codes with default settings(with finetuning), and the best preformance on imageNet(2-hops) is 25.49%/25.82%(SGCN/DGP).  It seems there is a little degradation with your paper(26.2%/26.6% for SGCN/DGP).Do I miss something or you have some other tricks?  I find that one tenth of the pictures were randomly picked in 'evaluate_imagenet.py'. Maybe that's the reason?  By the way, I'll be very appriciate it if you can provide the 'best.pred'.  Thank you!   "
How can I find the file fall2011.tar
"Hi! Thanks for your code!   ImageNet dataset is unable to download all 22k images, could you please share your dataset to us?  Thanks!"
How much GPU memory do you use when training the dense gcn?    I am using the GTX2080TI  whose memory is 11G. But it always raises an error: RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory.
"How long does finetuning (20 epochs) take? I am at epoch 11 and it took about a day, so I expect the total tuning time will be roughly two days. Does that sound right? "
"in your paper, your model is trained for 3000 epochs, how much time do you spend in it"
In 6.4 you made a comparison between 1-hidden-layer GCN with attention mechanism and 1-hidden-layer GCN. Why the results of GAT-1 are so close to GCN-1 ? The attention mechanism really works?

In the paper, it mentions that ""As DGP, our SGCN model makes use of the proposed two-stage finetuning approach"", but did it use the descendant and ancestor patterns and weighting schema, like DGP as well?     From the code, it seems that SGCN is very similar to GCNZ. Their differences mainly are the number of hidden layers, training epochs and implementation details, is it corret?    Thanks very much!"

When training depth&pose in competition step,  weights λ is set to (1.0, 0.5, 0.05, 0). Since flownet and  masknet are fixed, why set the  λ flowloss to 0.5 and λ exploss 0.05?

"Could I get to know that if you use the `--spatial-normalize `? How should I use it and set the hyperparameters such as `-s`? I added the `--spatial-normalize` to train the depth and pose networks, but the results are very poor.   However, I found that other paper used it and had a performance improvement.

"hey, I traind all nets accroding to the readme file.When I tested posenet, I found that the camera pose in output was in 6DoF format and then converted to a 3*4 transformation matrix.    In a 3*4 transformation matrix, we usually think that the last column describes the translational motion of the camera.But when the test datas are pictures at the corner of the street,I feel that the network is not performing well when describing the translation.    For example,I chose five images as input .These images are all from the KITTI dataset.They described a street corner. In the transformation matrix of the output, three variables describing the translation, I think at least two variables should have a large change, however, there is only one.  This obviously does not describe the positional change of the camera during the turning of the vehicle. Detailed data are attached.    Where did I go wrong?    Thanks.         "

About the training algorithm, Are the first three initializations of pose/depth, flow, and motion are just one iteration, or several iterations of gradient descent?. On each iteration of the main loop, does each step (collaboration and competition) run 100K iterations? (I mean: 100K compet, 100K collab, 100K compet and so on.)    Thanks in advance,"

"Hi, I was reading evaluation.py and found some lines confusing:     For 'is_crowd' segments, category_id and segment id are stored in a dictionary, so it implies that  for each category, coco annotates at most one segment with is_crowd as true. In other words, suppose that there are two distant crowds of people, they are annotated with the same segment id. However, I can't find any support of this implication in the description of the panoptic dataset. Is this a feature of coco dataset?"

"In section 6 of ""Panoptic Quality"" paper, under ""Human annotations"", it is mentioned that PQ is symmetric, i.e. the order of ground truth and predictions is unimportant. In practice this does not seem to be the case, for example:        One of the reasons seems to be the special treatment of VOID class, for example predictions are not counted as false positives when their overlap with ground truth VOID is bigger than 0.5 (section 4.2 in the paper, under ""Void labels""). I think it enforces one interpretation of VOID, meaning ""not labeled"", when ignoring such areas would make sense. Alternative would be ""not known class"", in which case marking it with known class would count as false positive. The second interpretation is more common IMHO and would retain the symmetric property of the metric.    I suggest to change the interpretation of VOID to make the metric symmetric, or add it as a command-line option."

"When averaging SQ over classes, even those classes are taken into account where TP=0, i.e. which were not even recognized correctly. For those classes SQ=0, so they reduce average SQ considerably. At least for me this breaks the intuition of SQ being a metric that measures how well the segmentation matches ground truth. Consider this example:    class|IOU|TP|FP|FN|PQ|SQ|RQ  -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-  class 1|0.88|1|0|1|0.59|0.88|0.67  class 2|0.69|1|0|0|0.69|0.69|1  class 3|0.63|1|0|0|0.63|0.63|1  class 4|0|0|1|1|0|0|0  class 5|0|0|1|0|0|0|0  **average**|||||**0.38**|**0.44**|**0.53**    Even though per-class segmentation results were decent for first three classes, when averaged over all classes 0.44 seems unfair. Following the SQ calculation algorithm one could wonder how SQ can ever be smaller than 0.5. Simple solution would be to count only non-zero SQ results when averaging, i.e. in this case the average SQ would be 0.73.    At first I thought that this would break the nice PQ=SQ*RQ formula. But then I realized that averaging breaks it anyway. I understand that this brings up the question how to average PQ as well and it would be nice if the rules would be consistent. That's why I'm posting this as an issue to discuss rather than pull request."
Hi!    I am new to image segmentation and wanted to know if it's possible to extract the semantic and instance segmentation images using `visualization.py` script.

Is it possible to modify the visualization script somehow to get the two segmentation results for the sample images?    Thanks in advance

你好，当我使用您代码中的uncertainty loss进行训练的时候  loss = sum(1 / (2 * torch.exp(logsigma[i])) * train_loss[i] + logsigma[i] / 2 for i in range(3))  整个loss在经过几个epoch之后会一直是负的，请问您训练时是这样的情况吗？  此外，想问下您为什么logsigma全部初始化为-0.5。  谢谢！

"Hi,    I'm trying to run your `resnet_mtan.py` to do two semantic label tasks. I used your `utils.py` and `create_dataset.py. `    From `resnet_mtan.py` I modified the `# Task specific decoders` part as follows:         But I get this error (`AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'log_softmax'`):       Could you help me to solve the error?

"Hi, I ran your official MTAN-DeepLabv3 and find that miou decrease when training while picAcc stay steady and loss on validate set are increasing consistently.    I also modify it to become `resnet_split.py`, `resnet_single.py`, `resnet_cs.py`. Same trends can be found.     When training MTL model, benchmarks in depth and surface normal estimation are increasing/decreasing normally.    I also run `model_segnet_*.py`. Decreasing on miou when training also exists but is much smaller and imperceptible. I think it is because of low miou and accuracy with SegNet.    I'm a new hand in NYUv2 and segmentation, I am not sure whether it is because of overfitting.    Some implement details:    - I use the same code in `model_segnet_*.py` for compute miou and pixAcc except a slight modification to accelerate training.    - optimizer and lr_scheduler are the same with `model_segnet_*.py`    - for more details, my code can be find in   and      Here are some records(mtan, split, single, and mixed respectively):    !   !   !   !

I just have a few questions about it and hope you could help me.  1) After running the code and training for long enough, where the trained model will save? The wide resnet codes have torch.save at the bottom lines of the script. but the segnet models don't include the same lines and basically after the system finishes running the script I can't find any model as the result. Of course results of the evaluation on all 3 tasks will be given to me but I just can't find the saved model.    2) I also wanted to ask for your help about the prediction code. Is there a way to give the trained model and one desired image to some prediction script and get 3 different image outputs for semantic masks and depth plus the surface normalization?

"Dear Shikun Liu,    First of all, thanks for sharing your code.    I was checking it out and noticed that it has this line for your final loss used by both the dwa and equal weighting schemes:    `loss = torch.mean(sum(lambda_weight[i, index] * train_loss[i] for i in range(3)))`    In this line of code, I believe the torch.mean is not doing anything and might be confusing, as the input vector will be 1x1d, i.e., the sum of lambda * train_loss is 1x1-d.    Honestly, I am not sure if dividing the total loss by 3 would make any difference, but just to clarify, your intent was to have something like:    `torch.mean(torch.Tensor([lambda_weight[i, index] * train_loss[i] for i in range(3)]))`    or   `torch.sum(torch.Tensor([lambda_weight[i, index] * train_loss[i] for i in range(3)]))`      Thanks,    Joao       "

"Hello, I am using alphapose to estimate key points and perform pose alignment without segmentation. I don’t know how to modify it.Do I need to change the size of my picture?"
"First of all, Impressive work @liruilong940607 .    Secondly, This repo needs to have an extra file explaining how should input look, how to feed inputs and get outputs (and maybe explaining pre-processing steps as well). I am posting this because there are many ""issues"" posted in this repo discussing and wanting to know the same (including myself)."
"Hello @liruilong940607, thank you very much for this repo. I wanted to know if it is possible to train on a smaller COCO dataset than what is originally provided in the readme.    I tried looking into the keypoints JSON file and train2017 folder of images. But I'm not sure which data to modify.    During training, the process line (snippet below) indicates there are 14150 images in dataloader.        The train2017 directory contains 118288 images. (I found out by using `ls -1 | wc -l` in the train2017 directory)  The person_keypoints_train2017_pose2seg.json has the 149813 items in the ""images"" field. (Using pythons json module)  The person_keypoints_train2017_pose2seg.json has the 56599 items in the ""images"" field. (Using pythons json module)    I suppose that if I am trying to reduce the number of images the training process uses, I need to reduce the 14150 indicated by the dataloader, but I'm not sure how.     Thank you   "
I follow all steps but when I run   I find this error   
"when i dealed my private image as title I get some problem:  warnings.warn(""nn.functional.upsample is deprecated. Use nn.functional.interpolate instead."")  so, i ask can it influence pose2seg work normal?"
作者您好，在多人遮挡的图片上，用模型跑的效果很👍，但是多人的情况下，时间效率有些低（3-4人的图片150多ms），可以给点提升速度的建议吗？  用更小的backbone？ 简化segmodule ？
"In training, I notice that all InputMatirxs obtained by get_aug_matrix are all identical. It means that there is no translation/rotation/scale/etc. for any input image and pose pair.     Actually, there is little rotation angle as the default input argument for get_aug_matrix. And it's interesting to see these little changes are ALL suppressed when it's called. Could you please kindly explain the pros and cons of doing so? As stated in other issue, the released model works not that good when we pass poor human pose estimation results. Can we improve the issue with some active data augmentation during training? Many thanks! "
@liruilong940607 Thank you for sharing such a great work.  But I wonder why didnt you combine this network with human pose detection in order to make an end-to-end instance segmentation network ?
Thank you for releasing your code.  I have generated keypoints using OpenPose and converted them to Coco format (OpenPose has an extra neck keypoint that I removed). Each keypoint is a 17x3 array. The first two columns are X and Y coordinates and the last column is the confidence score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.  Is this keypoint format suitable for running inference on the pretrained pose2seg model?
I read the paper and I know that the network takes input as the pose and the image.  But I was just wondering 
"I seted up the dataset as the repo refered, but when I run `python train.py`, I got the error like this.      !     what should I do to solve this?"
"Hi,!Dear Researcher，  Thank you for your excellent work!  I can't access the dataset address provided by the dataset repo. Could you download it for me or give me a link to download?    Or anyone can help me? Thanks a lot!  :)"

"Pose2Seg model provided by author was used to generate instance segmentation on Crowdhuman dataset with the input of keypoints generated by AlphaPose model.  According to the visualization result, the instance segmentation is not so good compared to mask rcnn model because the performance of instance segmentation of Pose2Seg  depended heavily on keypoints performance.     The keypoints visualization:  !     The instance segmentation visualization:  !     I was amazed when I saw the visualization of instance segmentation in COCO or COHuman dataset. But when using another model to generate keypoints, the result is not good."

"Hi,   I love the work you have done.  But I wanted to run it on my own set of images or video ?  How should I do that?"
"Hi @liruilong940607, we are trying to reproduce the results of Pose2Seg.     For the test results without using GT keypoints (2nd row of Table 2a and 2b on your paper), i.e., using another pose estimator to predict the keypoints instead, I understand that you use Associative Embedding:   to generate the predicted keypoints first.     Are you able to share the same json file that contains the predicted keypoints from AE so we can reproduce the results?     Thank you! "
"Your work is fascinating.    Could you share some information on the environment you used, like OS (& version), python version, and libraries' versions (especially PyTorch)?    Also, when it comes to inference, How much GPU memory is required for a single image (let's say 512x512, same as your experiments)?    Thanks"

"你好，读完论文有几个问题，望解答  1） 4.1节说image + pose作为input，那么，  1.1）pose是怎么表达的？是heatmap吗，还是如Figure4,一样，画在原始图像上？  1.2)  “+” 的操作是什么意思？是concat，将heatmap（若是）和image按通道组合起来吗？    2）pose获取的问题：我在另外的issue里读到，你们用Associative embedding: End-to-end learning for joint detection and grouping方法提取pose，那么你们是否有用过MSRA的Simple Baselines for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking呢？bottom-up与top-down的结果对于你们这里的做segment的效果有影响吗？    3）既然skeleton feature是joint heatmap 与 PAF 叠在一起，那为什么不直接在原图上跑openpose的方法，然后可以直接affine-align operation把skeleton feature map给转过来，这样就省去了一次预测pose的过程。因为现在的pipeline实际上预测了2次pose（input一次，skeleton feature一次），如果我理解的没错，那么原文的做法是否有点冗余？    4）整个系统（Figure4所描述的）是end-to-end训练的吗？      "

"Hi,    I have been studying your paper, thanks for uploading your code with it !    I was wondering, when you apply SigmaConsensus, in the paper you use the formula (6) to compute weights, but in the code you only use the exponential part of this formula. Why is the factor \sigma^{-\rho} D(\theta, \sigma)^{\rho - 1} ignored in the computation of the weights ?    Best regards,  Clément Riu."
"Thanks a lot for your great work and code, do you have a plan to add support for rigid transformation estimation?     Best,  Xuyang"
"Is there a way to estimate Essential Matrix using DefaultEssentialMatrixEstimator() for cameras which don't have camera intrinsic matrices (for eg, 360 degree cameras)"
"Hi,  your paper is very interesting, thanks for sharing the code!    Just out of curiosity. In some of my old experiments (see "" "", Table 5), I found that the geometric epipolar error (i.e. sqrt(e12^2+e21^2)) is usually more robust than the symmetric epipolar error. Did you also try some kind of similar error with MAGSAC?    Thanks again,  Fabio "
"Firstly, thanks for your contribution!    When I run your demo example, I met such an issue, could you please help me fix it?    !     My opencv version is 3.4.6"

"Hello Daniel,     I saw your talk at EECVC and I tried to clone your C++ MAGSAC project and get it to run on Ubuntu 18.04.  I was unable to do so w/o some alterations, some notes:    1- it is not obvious from the README that one has to clone and then copy the `src` folder from your `graph-cut-ransac` repo to the folder in `magsac/graph-cut-ransac` (which is empty when cloning magsac).  By reading through the CMakeLists.txt file I figured it out and was able to configure/generate with Cmake and then build.    2- I set the CREATE_SAMPLE_PROJECT var as follows `set(CREATE_SAMPLE_PROJECT` ON)` and Cmake generation failed:     `    I changed the `target_link_libraries()` section in `CREATE_SAMPLE_PROJECT` and it generated, built, and I can run it now:     `    A question, I see that you are linking with OpenMP, but I didn't see anywhere in the paper where you mention parallelization or implementation details (but I only did a high-level read).  Is the OpenMP for speeding up the OpenCV parts of the code, or do you use parallelization currently in the MAGSAC++ algo? "
"Hi @danini,  I am trying to aplicate the magsac algorithm with my work, in a part of my work I need to estimate the fundamental matrix, but in my case I need points in 3d, because I am working with 360 images in spherical domain(I project the image points to a sphere) and my z-point is not one, I notice that in the magsac the algorithm for fundamental matrix load only 2d points. It would be great to extend to 3d points. I am trying to do that.    Or Do you have a version with 3d points for the fundamental matrix?    Greetings and thank you,  Jeffri"

"I've been playing around with the   and believe I've found a much simpler representation that leads to more straight-forward implementation (no explicit loops/scans or custom gradients). Performance is comparable, though compilation/tracing time is orders of magnitude faster. I'd be happy to put a PR in with changes, but I realize these types of improvements aren't necessarily a high priority so thought I'd check here first to see if there's demand for it here first.    TL;DR: the implementations below, compared to the tensorflow implementation in this repo:  - is way less code (~5 lines of logic for numerator/denominator, compared to ~50)  - jit-compiles faster (thanks to no explicit python loops)  - gives the same results in roughly the same time using basic dimensions    Implementations/benchmarks/tests are available  .

I try to compute the flops of lightweight vct in one training step, with batch size 1, frame dimension (1920*1080) and the num_frame I set 3 here.

"Hello,  I have question about the description in the sectioni 4.3 of the paper  ""In all the following experiments in this section, we compute our Pr-VIPE embeddings on single video frames and use the negative logarithm of the matching probability (7) as the distance between two frames. Then we apply temporal averaging within an atrous kernel of size 7 and rate 3 around the two center frames and use this averaged distance as the frame matching distance. Given the matching distance, we use standard dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to align two action sequences by minimizing the sum of frame matching distances.""      Why we need matching distance as input for DTW to align two video sequences? Do you mean the distance function used in DTW is different from the default( L2 distance), and we should use matching distance function you describe above?         And also in section 4.3.2   ""We measure the alignment quality of our embeddings quantitatively using Kendall’s Tau [12], which reflects how well an embedding model can be applied to align unseen sequences if we use nearest neighbor in the embedding space to match frames for video pairs.""    As far as I understand, you use KNN to align two video sequences, which is somehow different from 4.3 description.      Thank you!      "

I.e. the same example, in two different batches will have a different FFT outcome, if those batches have a different max sequence length (which everything gets padded to). "

"I wonder if SCANN supports large dataset in general. For example, to train the sift1B (1 billion x 128 dim) dataset on a small machine with 64 GB of memory, I need to memmap the dataset and pass it to the scann's builder. However, seems SCANN only supports to load the dataset fully in memory before it can start training.     Is there any way to train large dataset given constraint memory (like faiss)? Or is SCANN designed for rather small datasets only?       "

"I noticed that the   only contains a single ""test"" split encompassing the whole dataset, instead of a train-test split. While writing an   to correct this, it became apparent that the splits used for the experiments of the   were not completely clear, at least to me.    The paper mentions a four-way split of the full variant of MBPP in subsection 2.1:  > In the experiments described later in the paper, we hold out 10 problems for **few-shot prompting**, another 500 as our **test** dataset (which is used to evaluate both few-shot inference and fine-tuned models), 374 problems for **fine-tuning**, and the rest for **validation**.    The paper doesn't explicitly state the task ID ranges of the splits, but the  , which is referenced in the paper, does:  > We specify a train and test split to use for evaluation. Specifically:  >   > * Task IDs 11-510 are used for evaluation.  > * Task IDs 1-10 and 511-1000 are used for training and/or prompting. We typically used 1-10 for few-shot prompting, although you can feel free to use any of the training examples.    I.e. compared to the paper, the few-shot, train and validation splits are combined into one split, with a soft suggestion of using the first ten for few-shot prompting.    It is not explicitly stated whether the 374 fine-tuning samples mentioned in the paper have Task ID 511 to 784 or 601 to 974 or whether they were randomly sampled from Task ID 511 to 974. The total number of samples is misstated as 1000 instead of 974.    Regarding the edited variant of the dataset, the paper states the following:  > For evaluations involving the edited dataset, we perform comparisons with 100 problems that appear in both the original and edited dataset, using the same held out 10 problems for few-shot prompting and 374 problems for fine-tuning.     The language here doesn't appear to be very precise, as among the 10 few-shot problems, those with Task ID 1, 5 and 10 are not part of the edited variant, and many from the task_id range from 511 to 974 are missing (e.g. Task ID 511 to 553).  I suppose the idea the Task ID ranges for each split remain the same, even if some of the task_ids are not present, but I think this should be stated explicitly (if it is the case).    "

"This is not an issue but a question rather. I had been evaluating Scann few months back and came across this project:   . I spent some time in coming up with the framework code for Scann and the PR can be found here     I couldn't get the time to continue on this further but before I did that, I realized I should ask it here.  I am not a google employee so I am not quite sure if I should be proceeding with submitting for these evaluations without the consent of researchers at google. There are some deadlines for submission etc so wanted to understand if anybody from google research would be interested in participating in this ? If yes, then would it be a collaborative effort where I can also chime in or somebody from your side would pick this up? And if it's a no, then well I can also pause this effort :) "

"Hello! I am trying to replicate VATT.    I am trying to generate DMVR records as required for the two datasets you used for text-to-video retreival.

I'm unable to reproduce reported results for implicit_pdf on the SYMSOL1 dataset.

"Hi, appreciate of your great work! But i have some confuse about loss function.    if we have a minibath data: A， A1，A2，A3，B，C，D，E. Ai belongs to one class, and B, C, D, E belongs other 4 class.    the paper said eq2 let more positive data pair contribute to loss function, and positive pair (such as A•A1, A•A2, A•A3)  becomes lager, negtive pair  (such as: A•B, A•C, A•D) becomes smaller.    The eq2 indicate that the numerator inside log still only have one positive data pair and the denominator have all positive and negtive pair each calculate.    If A is anchor, A1，A2，A3 are positive data, and B，C，D，E are negtive data. the part of eq2 is：   （log（A•A1 / ( A•A1 + A•A2 + A•A3 + A•B + A•C + A•D + A•E）+       log（A•A2 / ( A•A1 + A•A2 + A•A3 + A•B + A•C + A•D + A•E）+       log（A•A3 / ( A•A1 + A•A2 + A•A3 + A•B + A•C + A•D + A•E））/ 3       then, when loss is going down, the numerator (such as A•A1) in log is going to get bigger and the denominator is going to get samller. Is that correct? It seems like every elements in denominator is going to get smaller expect A•A1. So that means A•A2, A•A3 in denominator are going to get smaller？Logically, the values of A•A2, A•A3 should be larger.    I'm confused about this.  looking forward to your replies!   "

"     I just can't understand why the occlusion mask is generated by comparing between `frame1transformed_depth.depth` and `frame2depth_resampled`. Since `frame1transformed_depth` is at frame2's location, `frame2depth_resampled` is at frame1's location, what's the meaning of compare the depth at the same pixel when they are at different location? Does not compare `frame1depth` and `frame2depth_resampled` at the same pixel more reasonable?"

"Hi,    I have been looking into the Meta Pseudo Labels paper   and checking out the corresponding code herein. First of all, thanks for the great work and sharing the code. I have a couple of questions regarding the batch size used in the paper.    1. The paper mentions (Section 3.3 Implementation Details) about using a batch size of 4096 images for labelled data and 32768 for unlabelled data in a single iteration step. I was thinking about the impact if the Student is updated using pseudo labels on unlabelled data with a batch size of 4096 and repeat the process 8 times (effective batch size of 32768) and then update the Teacher with the feedback of Student's performance on 4096 labelled images. Could you please share your thoughts on this, or if you tried any experiments with this strategy?  2. How would the method perform if trained with a smaller batch size, e.g. 256, 512 etc? Would its performance be close to the paper results or drop down significantly?    It would be really great if you could provide some insights into the above queries on batch size or if you have some results with these that you could please share.    Looking forward to your reply.    Thank You !!    Anuj"

"I've noticed when using a custom data split with this repo, theres no silence or unknown audio added to the dataset, similar to how it is added in when the default subfolder organization is used. It's simple to add an unknown class by just adding a 'unknown' folder in the dataset with a bunch of random audio files, however, this solution doesn't add silence clips, and it's tedious to make a directory full of silence clips. I've added a simple way to add silence in my own local copy of this repo.

"Thanks for your awesome work!     I am confused about the order of training, which is described in the first paragraph in Part 4 of your paper as this ""In order to approximate regret, we use the difference between the payoffs of two agents acting under the same environment conditions. Assume we are given a fixed environment with parameters fixed policy for the protagonist agent, and we then train a second antagonist agent, πA, to optimality in this environment. Then, the difference between the reward obtained by the antagonist, and the protagonist.""    So, the env_adversary will first generate an env based on the fixed policy of the Protagonist, then the Antagonist will be trained to optimality on this env. After training the Antagonist, we will compute the reward obtained by the Antagonist (already been trained) and Protagonist (not yet been trained) on this env. However, in your implementation, I could not find the order of training follows this way.

For example, if we take all elements of activation tensors as features, then the dimension would be N x (C*H*W) which is huge for working matrices to fit into memory. Other ways can be to take spatial mean(N x C) or channel mean(N x H*W). Does someone know what preprocessing is done to calculate CKA on neural network like resnets"
" Hello, I am trying to use DVRL and apply it to the data evaluation for text classification.    Besides the blog and adult dataset, I add another two public datasets: sst-2, AG News for experiments.  For simplicity and consistency, I use pre-trained sentence encoder to project each sample of text into embedding, which is of 1024 dimension.(I have validate the effectiveness of the projector and if I use a simple one-layer network on top of it, the accuracy is ok, about 0.8+).    Other settings follow the script of      I use AUC to measure the performance of DVRL, because clean samples are expected to be ranked higher than corrupted ones, in terms of the scores from DVE network. AUC measures the ranking ability. (the marks of clean samples are 1 while 0 for corrupted samples, whose labels are distorted intentionally)    This is my implementation:        I run each dataset multiple times, with the exactly same settings.         However, I find that the auc is not stable each time.  For the AG and SST-2 datasets, here is the metrics of all trials.    !     The blog and adult datasets bear the same outcomes.    My question is how to avoid this unstability and what is the cause for that ?    Thanks.   "
"Hi @hyhieu, thanks for sharing this neat idea with academia.    Currently, I am applying the idea of MPL for my own project, and having trouble with computing the gradients for the   teacher network.    In the original paper, the gradient for updating the teacher network is defined as below.   !     From the fruitful  , I found that `dot_product` term ('h' in the paper) is related to the Taylor series approximation.     However, unlike the paper   , the term is   subtracted in the Taylor is computed via 'labeled' samples and labels, while the original paper claims that term should be computed on the unlabeled samples with pseudo labels.    I assume the code implementation is correct, but the paper still makes me suspicious about the term.  I wonder if the paper has typos in explaining the term 'h'.    Thanks in advance."

"Hi,   Thank you very much about all the sharings! I am currently trying to work on TCC - Temporal Cycle-Consistency Learning - but there is a technical question I can't figure out.  What exactly does the network sees? At first I thought it was pairs of videos of the same class, but the loss takes in account 1 batch of samples.    It seems that the loss is computed over all pairs of samples in the batch, but what is the condition on the samples of the batch? In particular, in the paper it is said that ""The core contribution of this work is a self-supervised  approach to learn an embedding space where two similar  video sequences can be aligned temporally."". So I would find it weird to align 2 videos that aren't similar (like pouring/tennis serve).    Do you know where in the code can I find information about such stuff?

"Hello,    Can you please clarify your variable selection method, that is used in Temporal Fusion Transformer?    It seems that it has an enormously large number of trainable parameters for electricity dataset:  number of entities is 370, and hidden_layer_size is 160.  So in input we will have tensor of size (batch_size, n_timestaps, 370), and after   method tensor will be converted to (batch_size, n_timestaps, 160, 370). When the tensor is flattened it will have shape (batch_size, n_timestaps, 59200), and GRN layer has to process about 30 million of trainable parameters (59200 * 160 * 4). If we add sizes of GRN layers from each individual feature (160 * 160 * 4), the total number of parameters will be close to 70 million, which seems quite big in comparison with LSTM and MultiHeadAttention sizes (200k and 100k respectively).

Fine-tuned models also used the same batch sizes as for pre-training, and BERT’s default learning rate (5 × 10−5). For both, we gradually warm up the learning rate for the first 10 % of examples, which is BERT’s default value.    What do you mean by with batch sizes 8,192, 4,096, 2,048, and 1,024?

But for evaluation when I run `python -m tcc.evaluate --alsologtostderr --logdir $MODEL_DIR`, I get a very high training loss like ~1.000. And I got a very small value for the kendalls tau task like 0.02. Though alignment looks working quite well.     I am wondering what could cause this discrepancy in the training loss between training and evaluation. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you!"
Thanks for uploading the PG-19 checkpoints and the 'routing_transformer' scripts.     'routing_transformer_test.py' works but I'm unclear how to run inference from the scripts as per the published paper.    I would appreciate an example to run. Using ubuntu 18.04 and tf 1.15     Cheers

"Hello,  I am planning to work on 3D object detection using tf3d.  I am curious to know is it possible to use my own custom dataset to train a object detection model? As on repository it is mentioned that currently it supports only 3 datasets (waymo, rio and scannet).  If Yes, than please can any one help me in preparing .tfrecord with which i can train tf3d object detection model? As i don't have much experience in this filed.    Right now i am able to train the tf3d object detection model with only following waymo dataset source:(gs://waymo_open_dataset_tf_example_tf3d/original_tfrecords/train-00000-of-01212.tfrecords .)

"Hi,    In ""Rethinking Attention with Performers"", in the appendix, section D.5, Performers seem to be faster than Linear Transformers. I'm not sure I understand how.     Let's assume we're in a base case  (nb_heads, nb_layers, d_ff, d), and we have a sequence of size n:   - Linear transformer simply applie `elu(x) + 1`, thus converts out input from `(batch_size, nb_heads, sequence_length, d // nb_heads)` to `(batch_size, nb_heads, sequence_length, d // nb_heads)`   - Performer converts input from `(batch_size, nb_heads, sequence_length, d // nb_heads)` to `(batch_size, nb_heads, sequence_length, m * l)` (m being the number of random vector we use, and l the number of kernel functions).      Performers approximation should be slower, unless `m*l < d // nb_heads` right? "

"Dear @sarahooker , @doomie   thanks a lot for the nice work and code.   I have a question regarding the ranking algorithm. E.g. in the `compute feature ranking()` in ""data_input.py"", the saliency map is regarded as a 3-channel map and the ranking is for each channel separately.   It means that for one pixel ( (x,y) coordinate) in an input image,  two of the channels could be removed but one channel left. Is that correct?   Thank you very much!    Best,"

"Hi @gariel-google,  first of all thanks for your great work, also with   the default weight regularization is set to 1e-2, so it seems to be active by default. Also in the CVF   it is stated  !   that a l2 regularization term is used. Digging deeper in the code, special care is taken where the l2-weights are applied:  - In the Resnet encoder, the parameter is ignored.  - For the depth decoder, it is applied to each Conv2D and Conv2DTranspose layer.  - For the motion network, we apply it in the enocder, decoder, and refinements in the v2-variants, but only to the encoder in the v1-variants.    If I load the   in my new implementation and train with the same l2-weight, I get a quite high l2-loss. Additionally, in your reference training code I didn't find a call to `tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES`, so I'm now wondering if this l2-regularization is really active.

"Hi @agarwl ,    Thanks for uploading the PSE code. I have a question about running PSE on dm-control.

"Referring to the paper, it says ""With product quantization we encode each datapoint into an M dimensional codeword, each with k possible states"".  Here, k directly relates to the compression rate of the dataset so I wanted to know how ScaNN's behavior differs as k varies. However, I could not find a parameter to set k and it seems like k is fixed to 16 in the code.    Is there any reason why ScaNN only supports k=16? If it is, is it because to maximize the benefit of SIMD instruction?  Or is there other way to adjust k?"

This is not an issue I'm just wondering that the reasoning is behind      1. Why are Q and K the same (byproduct of random setting random seed to 0). Interestingly even though K uses the same seed the result is different (because different shape?).   2. Why is `nb_random_features` set to 10000. Is this just to verify the approximation works at all? Obviously the whole point of the FAVOR mechanism allows `nb_random_features` << sequence length.    Context: I think this is wonderful and I'm working on notebook(s) for   with the aim explaining FAVOR in an accessible way.

"Hi,     The dependencies you detail in the `requirements.txt` are not working.    Long story short:     1. Update the `readme.md` by saying that to run the code, `python==3.6` is needed (I actually tested in on `python3.6.9`). (This step can be made via `virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 ~/env`)  2. Update the `requirements.txt` as follow:         Here, I detail the reason for this update.      I followed all the steps described, using virtual env and installing the prerequisites.  Doing that, I get the following error from `pip`:         I found out that this issue is given because I was using python 3.8.  I, therefore, recreated the virtual environment using python 3.6.  Doing that, the installation of the requirements proceed fine. However, once running          I get a long list of warnings           followed by an error         After seeing this error, I installed the newest `tensorflow==2.4.1`, which, instead, raises the issue       To solve this, I found out that one needs to use `tensorflow-2.2.0`.    Doing that, however, I had a problem with cloudpickle:         I found out that there is an incompatibility between `tensorflow-probability` and `cloudpickle`.  I've therefore switched to `tensorflow-probability-0.10.1` that aims to overcome this issue and requires `cloudpickle==1.3.0`.    This solved the problem.  "

"@tkipf I'm trying slot attention with higher level features.    Hard K-means variant trains very fast, while the full attention variant with `slots = updates` is prone to gradient blow-up (probably because of softmax and maybe), even with warmup.     It seems that the `slots = updates` variant does not do residual update in contrast to GRU (which in return requires learned parameters). Does it make sense to first try some residual / momentum `slots = alpha * slots_prev + (1 - alpha) * updates`?    Also it turns out that temperature `sqrt(slot_size)` is too high, I've had to decrease it for softmax not converging to uniform assignment.    Could you recommend what gradients / distributions should I monitor? Gradients wrt projection weights? Gradients wrt inputs?    Have you tried using more than 3 iterations in training? E.g. 10 iterations? Was it still stable?"
"Hi!  Thanks a lot for the great work! I am considering using ROAR in my own research but would like to clarify something first. In the paper and also in the README you mention that you use the estimated feature importance, and you write   > A feature importance estimate is a ranking of the contribution of each input pixel to the model prediction for that image.    From my own experiments with some of the methods, e.g. Integrated Gradients, I know that the attributions can also be negative. I couldn't find any hint how negative attributions are treated. I could imagine a few possible solutions, therefore I was wondering if you could clarify how it is done. Are the contributions ranked by their absolute value, are negative values ignored, are the contributions sorted from large positive to large negative values?    Thanks a lot for your time, I would really appreciate an answer!  Best regards  Verena  Haunschmid    tagging: @sarahooker @doomie"

"Hi @uniqueness and @gariel-google ,    Thank you for providing the code for this wonderful work! I have some questions and hopefully you will get back to me.    1. What is the general purpose and significance of this  ? Why do you compute the mean_sq_residual_translation over all residual translations in the batches instead of independent mean_sq_residual_translation for each residual translation in the batch? If I recall correctly then the 0th dimension should have batch, and this   will take the mean over the entire batch.     2. I tried training your object motion model on the Kitti data set but the residual translations in some images were not sparse which affected the entire performance of the model. How can I change alpha and beta in the motion regularization to make them more sparse and constant throughout a moving object?     3. Did you try predicting object motion without using depth information? If so, how were the results? Do you think its possible to extract motion maps without using depth since this method requires us to predict depth for 2 frames?    4. Is your method extendable to an ""n"" frame sequence like in other methods? Did you try 3 frames?    Thanks !"

"Hi there,    I really enjoyed reading the paper by @hyhieu et al.! I don't have the resources to train the models, or even run the code, but I do have some questions about the code. Especially about the loss of the teacher model. If I'm understanding correctly, the final loss is defined here:          I have a question about the MPL term. `cross_entropy['mpl'] * dot_product`.    `dot_product` seems to be a scalar (like mentioned in the paper), without gradient computation:         `cross_entropy['mpl']` seems to be defined a few lines above:       This seems to be a cross-entropy where the logits and targets are the same (since `softmax_cross_entropy` also applies a softmax to the logits). This loss can be non-zero when the targets are not 'hard' (soft targets), however, I don't think there is any signal in that case? Since the logits and targets seem to be equal.     My question is — if I'm understanding the code correctly — if there is no signal and it's scaled by the `dot_product`, I do not know what the value is of this term in the optimization?

To check if it is only a problem of camera extrinsics, which would explain the good position but bad orientation, I converted the EuRoC to Colmap :      And then I used the point triangulator :   to know if there was a rigid transformation offset.    It turns out that the transformation is not constant, otherwise, we wouldn't get this reconstruction :     !       Here is one reconstruction when we map everything from scratch without using groundtruth pose, and you can see that the model is much sharper :    !       What are your thoughts on this problem ? Thanks is advance for your help    I do concede that the subject is very broad, but criticizing EuRoC odometry is a very strong claim so I prefer a second opinion :)"

My trained model appears to be doing as well as can be expected, given how aberrant the pandemic trends have been in the US; however, I'm wondering if TFT necessitates stationarity transformations in this case or if the sequential attention is able to learn to deal with this on its own fairly effectively (given that obviously the more feature engineering that is done can help improve model performance but then again part of the appeal of TFT is that one can avoid much of that work through the model).    Thanks for your thoughts. Much appreciated!"

Can we share the pre-train encoder model so that we don't need to re-train it from scratch?     Thanks.
"I am having difficulty in understanding that why does the `tft` code uses previous observations which are also targets? For example using electricity example, and if `total_time_steps` are 192 and `num_encoder_steps` are 168, I understand that the model uses 168 previous values to predict next 24 values (or their quantiles). But the input data i.e. `data` in line   has the shape `(450000, 192, 5)` while the `labels` have shape `(450000, 24, 5)`. However the last 24 values in `data` are exactly what the 24 values of `labels` are. For validation I ran following lines of code during debugging after line         and it only prints 0s.     My question is if we are required to feed the target values as inputs, then what is the point of having a model? What am I missing? "

If I just train a BERT with 6 Layers without distillation, does the performance look bad?    3. Do you have to do pretraining every time you change the layer number of  BERT? Is it possible to just remove some layers in an existing pre-trained model and finetune on tasks?       Thanks,  ZLK  "

The result without training and directly infering on cityscapes pretrained weights provided in the repo is little better.  !   I took the inference code from struct2depth and replaced their model with depth_from_video_in_the_wild's model  When I plot the egomotion with the trained model, it looks ok.  Can I know what might have gone wrong while training?  Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.   "

"Dear scannn authors,     I would like to bring your attention on recent work brining SIMD distance evaluation to FAISS. The work includes methods for doing SIMD lookup for larger tables thus allowing more precise distance (than with 16-values tables as done your work) while keeping the advantage of SIMD using recently-released AVX512-capable processors. I believe the method could be applied to scannn similarly to how QuickerADC extends QuickADC.     See   for source code.    The corresponding paper is available as preprint: IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence          Best regards"

"### 1. The entire URL of the file you are using         ### 2. Describe the bug    I'm trying to create training, validation and test set files in ""Process Kepler Data"" section.         The process seems to start without any issues and it starts to create tfrecords, but after a while I get this error:  **""ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (4,43) into shape (4,39)""**    ### 3. Steps to reproduce    **1. Setup the environment**  The following libraries are required:  tensorflow==1.15  tensorflow-probability==0.8  pandas  numpy  scipy  astropy  pydl  absl-py    Ensure that test and build pass         `bazel build astronet/...`    **2. Download Kepler data**    First, download the DR24 TCE Table in CSV format from the   and ensure the following columns are selected:    -    rowid: Integer ID of the row in the TCE table.  -    kepid: Kepler ID of the target star.  -   tce_plnt_num: TCE number within the target star.  -   tce_period: Period of the detected event, in days.  -   tce_time0bk: The time corresponding to the center of the first detected event in Barycentric Julian Day (BJD) minus a constant offset of 2,454,833.0 days.  -  tce_duration: Duration of the detected event, in hours.  -  av_training_set: Autovetter training set label; one of PC (planet candidate), AFP (astrophysical false positive), NTP (non-transiting phenomenon), UNK (unknown).       ### NOTE: the following script take up about 90 GB.    **3. Process Kepler data**         ### 4. Expected behavior    When the script finishes you will find 8 training files, 1 validation file and 1 test file in TFRECORD_DIR. The files will match the patterns train-0000?-of-00008, val-00000-of-00001 and test-00000-of-00001 respectively.    ### 5.

"I compared the results of Depth from wild and PSMNet.  The size of the 3D point Cloud detected by 'Depth from video in wild' was much larger than the size of the 3D Point Cloud of PSMNet.  Like this             Does the depth image detected from depth from 'Depth from video in wild' contain the depth value or disparity value.       I know that 'Depth from video in wild' learning intrinsic, but do this still detect depth values relatively?  The performance of intrinsic learning is good, so it seems that i can get a value similar to the absolute depth value.    "
"Hi, I'm interested in using the multitask BAM network, where both the multitask model and the teacher models are ELECTRA. The question I have is since one of the tasks I need done is MLM while the other is classification, and they're done by different models (in ELECTRA the generator and discriminator respectively), can they be used as teachers for BAM? Because as I understand from the paper the teachers must have the exact same model archtecture as each other and as the student, and in this case the generator and discriminator are different models.    Thank you!"

You guys are creating a huge amount of great libraries and codebases with great explanations. But TF1 is really old and tired with it's alien syntax.    I'm mostly a pyTorch user but TF2 is really fine and dandy with how similiar it is to pyTorch and normal python syntax. Since most researchers basically use pyTorch its really hard to expect a new researchers to learn read old TF1 codes.            2 example of great libraries/code bases stuck with TF1 forever.    Please consider them upgrading to TF2

"@kevinkilgour     I tried to convert the model provided at   to TFLite but unfortunately failed.    ### Setup:  - tensorflow 2.2.0rc2  - tensorflow-hub 0.8.0    ### Conversion  I tried the following:  1. Manually downloaded the model from    2.    ### Error  I get the following error:       I tried as well to enable the new converter (`converter.experimental_new_converter = True`) but that didn't help either.    ### Questions  1. Do you guys have a tflite version of the model that you would be willing to publish to tfhub?  2. Am I doing something wrong with the conversion? If so, please let me know.  3. Is there something you guys would need to change in the model to support TFLite? If so, would you be willing to perform that necessary change?    Thanks a lot for your help and the great work you have done with the speech_embedding model. Much appreciated.    "
"In the TFT branch, is there a reason why the multi-class is not activated? After looking at the code, it seems that the model itself can handle it. Thus, beside removing the lines throwing error and using target_col instead of [target_col] in few places, as the target column is now an array, I haven't seen much change to do to handle multi-class."
"For the following reference/summary pair:         Looking at the unigrams extracted from each, for the PERL implementation, the stemmer will stem say -> sai and says -> say, while the nltk stemmer (nltk==3.4.5) will stem both cases to 'say' and thus have a different unigram intersection. "

"Hi. As is the instructions for frechet_audio_distance give errors:       This seems to be due to a change in Tensorflow models, where the vggish directory was moved.

"Throughout the repo there are a variety of executable shell scripts with shebang/interpreter lines (`#!`) that are not at the start of the relevant files (usually underneath a copyright notice). These are not parsed correctly and will be ignored as the shebang is only valid as the first two bytes of the file, see   as an example implementation.    It is likely that this was not noticed due to the majority of shebang lines specifying `/bin/bash` as the interpreter: if executing the scripts under bash this would behave mostly the same. However, a few scripts specify `-e` and `-u` which will get swallowed.    Files with shebang lines in the wrong position can be found using the following invocation:     when executed from the repository root. As of 5e864806, this lists:    "

"I have been trying to understand for how many steps (ie. gradient updates) the final Meena model (`10.2`) perplexity was trained for as it's not directly mentioned in the paper.    I think it's indirectly mentioned twice that points to around `2.5M` updates:    1) [Section: 3.3] Batch size: 4M tokens, Total tokens seen: 10T. so gradient updates comes around 2.5M    2) [Section: 3.3] Step time: 1 second, Total training time: 30 days, So number of steps: `~2.59M`.      But if above is true, there's seems to be some discrepancy or ambiguity with the following in the paper:    1) [Section: 3.2]     Which seems to indicate `738K` steps.      Am I interpreting the line in section 3.2 wrong? Can you please clarify this?    Thanks"

"Hello, I was wondering how you ends up with 1 ET, 13 ET blocks on models.    From the paper,    > The best performing Meena model is an Evolved Transformer (ET) (So et al., 2019) seq2seq model with 2.6B parameters, which includes 1 ET encoder block and 13 ET decoder blocks.    Does it means you also find Meena structure using evolutionary NAS structure?   I would like to know how you get 1 ET and 13 ET structures since the numbers are not normal for me.    Thanks."

"Greetings google-research developers and contributors,    We’re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem, and we’d like to invite you to integrate with our   service,  . OSS-Fuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project. OSS-Fuzz will:    - Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write.  - Alert you when it finds issues.  - Automatically close issues after they’ve been fixed by a commit.    Many widely used   like OpenSSL, FFmpeg, LibreOffice, and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSS-Fuzz, which helps them find and remediate  .     Even though typical integrations can be done in < 100 LoC, we have a   in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source, but are also working hard to make it more secure.    We want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSS-Fuzz is eligible for a reward.

"It appears that      can produce arbitrarily wrong gradients on trans_vec1 which then back-propagate to corrupt the depth estimation network with NaN weights.     The issue is caused by a `CUDA 10.0` bug   which is fixed in `TF 2 nightly` by upgrading to `CUDA 10.1`, however this network requires `TF 1.x`. One workaround would be to recompile `TF 1.15` with `CUDA 10.1` or to use CPU for all calculations.    But in any case, the network as-is won't train on GPU for more than a few steps before going NaN with any released TF version. So I'm writing this issue mainly to document that for others.    "

"I am doing research in unsupervised depth estimation. And thanks for the preliminary code in 'depth from video in the wild'.    In this project, it is necessary to generate data before training, which is similar in another project of the author  .

Without the segment file, the training cannot be conducted.    May I request the data generating code in the 'depth from video in the wild' project? Thank you very much."

I know that Learning Edge Representations via Low-Rank Asymmetric Projections, other baselines and many of the graph embedding literature doesn't use it for link prediction, but I feel that stopping based on validation from ROC-AUC scores is more appropriate than stopping by best train ROC-AUC.    2.a) I see that attention makes only little contribution to an increase in the performance. Uniform attention works well. For example, in PPI, the paper reports that the attention learned favors the first hop. But not learning any attention(or in other words, uniform attention) also performs equally well. This is true even for Soc-Facebook, Wiki-Vote, ca-HepTh, ca-AstroPh.     2.b)  Why is the stopping criteria in line 441  ""if i - 100 > eval_metrics['i at best train']:        LogMsg('Reached peak a while ago.

We always report metrics and save model that gives the best performance on the validation set. If we modify the code to report the AUC / precision scores at least validation error then there is little to no difference between having weights and trainable attention.    "

Hi!    Will the checkpoints of pre-trained PaLM models be released?     
"hi @agarwl    Thanks for releasing the code. However, I have some trouble when attempting to run the jumping-task code. I've downloaded the code under this  , and I've followed the README instruction and run `python -m jumping_task.train --train_dir . --training_epochs 1` under my `/pse` dir.     Here is what I got:       It seems like accessing a protected method in gym/core. So I downgraded the gym to 0.21. The problem stays still. Here is my environment:    - Ubuntu 20.04LTS  - RTX3090  - gym 0.21.0  - gym-jumping-task 0.0.1 (from anothor  )  - tensorflow 2.4.1    And I also downloaded all requirements in requirements.txt.    Any clue about solving the problem?"
"I am trying to train on my own dataset with alignment loss. I created the tfrecords from unlabeled videos using the videos_to_tfrecords code. However, when I run the train.py code, I get an error because the number of frames is None. I have checked the number of frames read during the tfrecord creation process and it is an integer greater than zero for each video."
"Hi. Thanks for greate repository.  I train kws on my dataset. I check logs and see program have loaded gpus.  But I noticed that sometimes, my gpus are idle (gpus usage down to 0%). I think this is because data loading is not responsive to gpus.   how can I increase the number of cores in data loading ?"

"I deployed the code following the ""Running in a virtual environment"" guideline on two different GPU servers, I found it will take very long (100 hours and 200 hours) to train even one model with low resolution. My cuda is 11.1.    !   !   !     Thanks very much."
"Thanks for this wonderful work.    The space annealing formula (13) is different between the google drive and arxiv version.  Google drive:  <img width=""254"" alt=""image"" src=""   arixv  <img width=""213"" alt=""image"" src=""   Since `Ps` stands for ""start range"" and the sampling region should be lied in `[t_near, t_far]`, I think google drive version is correct.

"Hi,     I am hoping to use ScaNN in my real-time recommendation system application (developed with Tensorflow Recommenders   where the candidate embeddings sit in a distributed database. Do you have advices or directions on how to set this up?    My idea is to separate partitioning and the AH search phase. I can do (re-)partitioning regularly as a batch job, store the results in a n external database. At prediction time, I could quickly fetch the partition I need by partition key, and perform AH search in real-time. Does this makes sense?     If this is a way to proceed do you have API for partitioning and for scoring separately? I only found joint function for nearest neighbours?    Thanks!    Marin"
Should the downloaded checkpoints be stored in the model_dir directory? I got the following information:  I0329 09:37:26.503962 140321606702912 checkpoint_utils.py:140] Waiting for new checkpoint at vatt/finetune  It didn't seem to find the checkpoint I downloaded.

hi  I am assuming the model has been trained to give out only 256 dimension output right? can we get final output dimensions higher than 256? if so kindly tell were to specify the size. If not can we train it on our dataset and set a final dimension of our own on which the spatial upsampler will give desired output

I used  `self.num_gsw_layers = 1` for now.    Then I tried to run Chaformer_tall. the paper says,    > Our small model follows the T5 small model size with 6 encoder layers and 6 decoder layers, hidden size d_model of 512, 8 heads, d_kv of 32 and d_ff of 2048.

I'm trying to get the   of the   Transformer working and am running into some issues.    I looked at the   file and saw that `test_fast_attention` provides the following as input: `x = tf.ones([1, length, hidden_size])`. I'm confused how this would translate to my specific use case. My input shape is currently (1, 240, 24). The 240 value is the number of ""time steps"" worth of data I'm passing, with 24 being the number of features each time step has. It seems like I'm supposed to include a `hidden_size` dimension in the input tensor? This value seems to be referenced in `Attention.build` line 413 when creating `attention_initializer` where it passes the last element of the input's shape to `_glorot_initializer`. How can I include the ""feature count"" dimension (value of 24 in this case)? Would the input's shape look something like (1, 240, 24, hidden_size) in my case?"

Apols about my hacks but playing with the streaming CRNN I just used this to get something going.  Is there any chance you guys could provide some basic best methods of mic input inference.  Also the 'envelope' of the classification whats the best way to process that rather than maybe a simple sum?    Should you always reset the state after another classification detection?     
"Thanks for the interesting paper,  I have a question concerning the pseudo labels that are computed using the teacher network. In section 2, subsection ""Practical approximation"" of v3 of your paper, you say that you use ""hard pseudo labels from the teacher distribution"" and that this prevents us form simply using backpropagation on equation (3).   However, is it really the case that you use one-hot-encoded pseudo labels generated by the teacher to train the student? Looking at the code, it seems like you just compute the teacher output with ""build_uda_crossentropy"", store them in ""logits"" and use them as-is without a one-hot-encoding. Am I missing anything?  €dith: I think this is the relevant part of the code:  ""  \# for backprop      cross_entropy['s_on_u'] = tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy(          **onehot_labels=tf.stop_gradient(tf.nn.softmax(logits['u_aug'], -1)),**          logits=logits['s_on_u'],          label_smoothing=params.label_smoothing,          reduction=tf.losses.Reduction.NONE)  ""  Also, if we actually use soft pseudo labels, why do we still have to use the complicated gradient of gradient/Taylor approximation like in appendix A and can't just use the differentiability of equation (3) as implied in the paper? Maybe I'm just misunderstanding what you mean by ""soft"" and ""hard"" pseudo labels.    Thank you very much for your help"
"@MechCoder  It seems that Colorization Transformer didn't have a script for single grayscale image inference.    I am not familiar with the TF2.0, thus there are also some questions for this open source code:    1. When i try to adapt the sample.py for single image inference, i found it will download the imagenet2012 dataset. Is this nessasary for sample.py?  2. Is there any difference between ”Sampling“ and ”inference“ ?"
"Thanks for your work having a pretty detailed documentation for the CuBERT source.    However, there appears to be some code missing from compared to what is in  . This issue is specifically about the finetuneing code for the downstream tasks.    I image there must exist code somewhere that loaded the dataset jsons and fed them into a BERT training loop, and then evaluated at the end. Could this code be released? (Apologies if I'm missing something if it's already there). It might be just be something that is hacked on top a fork of the BERT repo, and if that's the case, that's totally fine. It'd be really useful to see.    This is not just trivial implementation as some choices like how long functions (> 512 tokens) were finetuned/evaluated might effect downstream performance (I assume just truncating?). This makes it somewhat complicated to recreate/benchmark against CuBERT in followup research I am doing without the source.    See also issue #571 about instructions about using the finetuned models (but not necessarily creating them). Related also is my issue  #581 for missing CuBERT code for the pretraining corpus deduping (which could also be helped with the release of more of the original source).

"When downloading the CuBERT pretraining corpus, I encountered some questions with the deduping process. Section 3.2 of   mentions that there was a deduping process:    > .... This brought the dataset to 14.3 million files. We then further deduplicated the remaining files, by clustering them into equivalence classes holding similar files according to the same similarity metric, and keeping only one exemplar per equivalence class.This helps avoid biasing the pre-trained embedding. Finally,we removed files that could not be parsed. In the end, we were left with 7.4 million Python files containing over 9.3 billion tokens. This is our Python pre-training code corpus.    I downloaded  . There are indeed ~7.4M blobs. However, only about 4.1M of the SHAs are unique, implying over 3M point to repeat files. There about 0.9M instances of the SHA e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 which appears to correspond to an empty file. There are also thousands that correspond things like Django default files or 2626 instances of a SHA that corresponds to   which could slightly confuse modeling. See   if want to see how I checked the SHAs.    Any thoughts on why there might be identical SHAs? I don't see the scripts used for deduping in the repo, but deduping is rather difficult, so I get there are ways it could go wrong in confusing ways.    CC: @adityakanade @maniatis"

"@tkipf Do I understand correctly that it's 128x128 as stated in   (and the convolutional encoder seems to have stride=1 and padding=""same"")?    The image in the repo induces to think that it's 8x8, but 8x8 seems to be the resolution only  :  !     How important was this high resolution for relatively simple CLEVR-like images? Would it work if there was more subsampling in the network and e.g. the input resolution to the slot attention was 7x7 or 14x14 (like you would get out of resnet18 with effecive stride=8)    Thanks!"

"In tft prediction, how can we forecast Target feature value for future timestamps? tft.predict() method uses previous  num_encoder_steps timestamps to predict values (total_time_steps - num_encoder_steps). But, we're feeding these predicted values as input to tft model.   For E.g.: In volatility model,   total_time_steps = 252 + 5  num_encoder_steps = 252  So, when I feed 300 records, then after prediction, Target dataframe contains only 295 records and last 5 Input target values are in the prediction columns (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4). Predicted values are exactly same as that of Input target values.   How can we predict values for future timestamps?  I also tried by adding a dummy row (target column/observed inputs/known inputs = 0 with future timestamp) as the last record in test data but TFT prediction model is just copy paste Input test data as predicted output values.    I don't know if I am missing something.  "

"Is there any inference code for the video_structure repo?   As far as I can see, there is no code, which uses the keypoints generated from the VRNN (=predicted_keypoints) to generate the predicted image sequence. Instead it uses the keypoints extracted from the input sequence (=observed_keypoints)  The architecture to train the model is like   image_sequence --> keypoints --> reconstructed_image_sequence-->Recon loss  ...................................................|  ..................................................V  ....................................dynamics_model --> predicted_keypoints -->VRNN losses    reconstructed_images, observed_keypoints, predicted_keypoints is returned from the whole model. Due to this, reconstructed_images is not meaningfull if you want to see generated images from predicted keypoints from the VRNN.      Am I right? Did I get something wrong? As far as I can see, this code is only for training and not inference.  Is there already existing code to generate images from the predicted keypoints/inference? @mjlm "

"Hi,    I am looking at the genomics OOD dataset and the  .    The paper says: ""Among all the short sequences, we randomly choose 100,000 sequences for each class for training, validation, and test.""    Is the released   purely composed of these selected sequences used in the experiments? It doesn't seem to be so on first glance since the OOD test and validation datasets seem to be ~6x larger than the corresponding in-distribution datasets - if all cases had the same number of sequences, then they should be all the same size.    So it seems that the provided google drive actually contains all of the data, and from this dataset 100,000 sequences were subsampled per class for performing the experiments in the paper. Does a class here mean a bacterial name such as ""Actinoplanes, Advenella"" etc? Is there a script or function that performs this random sampling that I can use?    Thanks in advance. The dataset and experiments are very comprehensive and interesting. It would be great if I could have a little more clarity on these minor details.    Best Regards"

"@gariel-google  Dear author, Thanks for sharing the source code of the paper.     I have a question about the scale factor of the predicted translation vector.   Basically, I tried to use the predicted depth and  the predicted egomotion to warp the image T to image T+1.   I first project image T using the predicted depth get a 3D pointcloud then use the predicted translation vector, rotation matrix and camera intrinsic to project the 3D pointcloud back to an image space (T+1). However, I can’t get a proper warped image T+1 WITHOUT scaling the translation vector.  After some trial and error, I found that the scale factor for the translation vector is about 0.001.     Therefore, my question is: do you need such a scaling factor for the translation vector when you try to project image T to image T+1 (or inversely) to compute the reconstruction loss? I am quite confused as I understand the predicted depth’s scale and the predicted egomotion’s scale should be matched and thus we should be able to do reconstruction without scaling those variables.    Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance. "

"@gariel-google   Thanks for sharing the code about your paper.  I want to implement your method (in TF2), and I have got somewhat good results on KITTI dataset. Now, I'm trying to implement ""5.4. Camera intrinsics evaluation"". But I don't know how to ""represented each intrinsic parameter as a separate learned variable"".  Would you share me motion_prediction_net.py (TF1/Slim) that treats intrinsics as trainable_variables?  Thank you in advance."
"First of, I'd like to thank the authors for their interesting work! I'm not sure how to make a pull request to this repository, so I'll leave my thoughts here regarding TabNet training.     **Problem**:  TabNet training is slow because the parsing of the CSV is performed on the entire file each time, instead of performed over a single batch each time (see  ). This results in overhead in CPU processing, reducing the utilization of the GPU.     **Solution**:  In order to improve the training speed, we set the batching operation before the mapping operation so that the mapping operation only operates on a smaller set of data each iteration as follows:     In terms of GPU utilization on an RTX2080Ti, I am getting about 70% utilization compared to 28% previously. More could potentially be done but this is a start.    **Caveat**:  The unfortunate side-effect of this is that the last small batch would be dropped. Fortunately this has not impacted accuracy on a test set.    Padding was tried, but I think I am not getting the shapes right, so I've used this as a solution in the interim.    **Testing**:  Shown here are the test accuracy and test loss when tested on the CoverType dataset. When tested on the CoverType dataset, the accuracy reached on the test set is 96.23% for the final model.    !     !   "

"It appears that some of the variables in the motion_field_net from   are not being reused when the the model is initialized for the forward and inverse ego-motion prediction.    When inspecting the variables  using     and only considering variables in the scope 'MotionFieldNet'  there are four redundant name spaces:    ('MotionFieldNet/compute_loss/MotionFieldNet/...  ('MotionFieldNet/compute_loss/MotionFieldNet_1/...  ('MotionFieldNet/compute_loss/MotionFieldNet_2/...  ('MotionFieldNet/compute_loss/MotionFieldNet_3/...    However when I initialize the model and comment out the second call of motion_field_net (as in the following code block from  )     restoring from the kitti checkpoint and then re-saving yields only a set of variables under the name scope  ('MotionFieldNet/compute_loss/MotionFieldNet/...    without the scopes having the _1, _2 & _3 suffixes, Indicating that these variables are being copied instead of reused. It is my understanding that all of the motion_field_net variables should be reused for the forward and inverse ego-motion prediction.  "

"After 70,000 epoch of training, by obtaining the aligned frame numbers, and extracting the mapping vector of each frame according to the index， and then visualizing with T-SNE, it is found that the T-sne visualization in Figure 8 of your paper is not available. The alignment vectors I get based on the reference video cannot overlap.  Do you have any visual skills for setting up?  Another question, I would like to ask for the annotation of Penn-action, get the json file of your thesis, what kind of annotation tool can be used for you, and how to get the json file, I hope to get your help.I hope you can reply and urgently need your help.....@debidatta "
"I'm finetuning albert xlarge model with my joint training task of intent classification and slot filling,  and I tried many times, the model never converge.     Then I repalced the albert model with bert base, the code is working.    What's wrong? SOS    "
" I trained both Bert and Albert using same data(classification task).   After training         model size of **Bert** frozen graph() - 420MB        model size of **Allbert** frozen graph() - 48MB.    When I perform inference, both models are taking same amount of time.          Time take by **Bert** to classify for singe sentence  - 0.64sec (CPU) -- .0.028sec(K-80 GPU).          Time take by **AllBert** to classify for singe sentence  - 0.627816sec (CPU) -- .0.023sec(K-80GPU).    I have following questions:  1) Using Albert does not result in good inference time behavior. Only model size is reduced.  Is it expected behavior?    2) If not by how much factor **Albert** is faster than **Bert**(if possible please also provide H/W details.  3) is it not recommend to run the inference on CPU platform?       Thanks              "
"I'm trying to train with ~ 568 tfrecord files totaling upto 1.9 TB, created from ~30GB of text and generated using 128 max_seq_length and custom vocab comparable to the original vocab size.

Q1: Any idea what am I missing here?   Q2: Also, why is the train time so slow compared to BERT, which stepped through 10K/20 mins, here it seems 10K/1.15 hr or more?  Q3: What is the recommended batch size for single TPU instance and how does it impact the train steps and the learning rate?

"Hi! Many thanks for the interesting research!  The paper states:  > Networks with 3 or more layers are trained by fine-tuning using the parameters from the depth before (e.g., the 12-layer network parameters are fine-tuned from the checkpoint of the 6-layer network parameters).    I was wondering if this is deemed mandatory for the model to converge or was this simply a time saving mechanism to avoid starting from scratch?    Any insights would be great!  Many thanks,  Dom"

"@abdolence @ahotrod  Seems that some of the lines in the vocab file are just '\n', hence   results in an empty list. This error is solved by ignoring such empty lists.

"@sarahooker I really enjoyed the paper. I'd like to engage in a little speculation and I hope you'll indulge me.    ### Knowledge transfer during iterative sparsification    The lottery ticket result surprises me. I think you should be able to retrain to much closer to the same accuracy given the same initialization and a sparse mask. However I speculate that the magnitude pruning method induces knowledge transfer which prevents this.    Because the sparsity inducing mask changes during the iterative process you're dealing with some number of subnets. If they were fully disjoint you would transfer knowledge using one as a teacher and the other as the student. However in the iterative process you have a gradual knowledge transfer. Which means that the representations (and ultimate accuracy of the sparsified network) are no longer a function of sparse initial weights + training, but the full initial weights and the sparsification procedure.     If this is the case I suspect that if you do a single-step sparsification at the end of training and use *that* sparse mask along with the same initial weights (lottery ticket) you should see much closer accuracies.     (Iterative pruning is still a *better* way to do pruning of course.)    ### Knowledge reconstitution    I'm curious how much work has been done in the area of densifying sparse nets. For example, can you perfectly reverse the accurracy loss curves by increasing sparsity and retraining? Does it work better if you do this in one step (go from 90% sparsity to 70% sparsity by initializing a lot of random weights) or iteratively (90->85->80->75->70)    Ultimately the question is do you think a sparse bottleneck + densification + retraining procedure can produce a highly efficient and compressed version of finetuning?"

After setting up the environment according to requirements, we ran run_random_collect_oss.sh, and then run_train_collect_eval_oss.sh with dqn on-policy and dqn off-policy. The results shown in images below suggest the training didn't converge on policies with expected success rate, what steps should we take to reproduce similar results to those presented in the paper?    !   !   !   !

"Dear Team,    Thanks so much for releasing this great work together with the dataset. I wonder if your team would be interested  in sharing your models, dataset and the demo on HuggingFace Hub?    The Hub offers **free** hosting of over 93k models, 14k datasets and it would make your work more accessible and visible to the rest of the ML community. We can help you set up a Deepinsight organization.     Some of the benefits of sharing your models and weightss through the Hub would be:  * Free hosting of super large dataset thanks to git-lfs and fast distribution with global CDNs (including China)  * versioning, commit history and diffs  * repos provide useful metadata about their tasks, metrics, etc. that make them discoverable  * wider reach of your work to the ecosystem    Creating the repos and adding new models should be a relatively straightforward process if you've used Git before. Here are some step-by-step guide explaining the process in case you're interested.   - Add a model    - Add a dataset    - Add a Space demo      Example spaces with repos:  github:    Spaces:      github:    Spaces:      Example dataset:        Please let us know if you would be interested and if you have any questions.

"Hi, wondering if there are parameters I can change to allow the face to be recognised in this image.  I have seen other FR algorithms detect the face.  No feedback is given when I use the python api to look for a face here.      !   "
"Hi, it missed the evaluation file in jmlr.Could you please share it? @nttstar "
"Thanks for your great work. Is there any plan to release a toolbox for multi-person face tracking (i.e., simultaneously online or offline detection and tracking)? I think this will also be a widely-used downstream application. Thanks."
I'm trying to train and prepare custom dataset for 3 days. Can you please provide some guide to train arcface_torch?

"Thanks for sharing your excellent work!  I am looking through your code, and there seem to be some differences with the paper shared on arxiv (or I misunderstood something).  Are the data preparation, training, and configuration files the same as those used to train the pretrained-model you share?  Some examples:  1. in `rec_builder.py` line 79, `cfg.input_size = 512`. My understanding is that this results in image with size 512, not 256 as described in the paper  2. in `train.py` line 245, we have `iter_loss.backward()`, but `iter_loss = dloss['Loss']`, which does not include the ""bone_losses"". I.e. We only have L_vert + L_land in Eq. 4 in the paper on arxiv.    Thanks in advance."

I have recently found this amazing repo and I was looking at the model zoo.    I see that there is a ResNet50 model trained on WebFace600k that yields better results than the model trained with Glint360k. But for ResNet100 there is one model trained with Glint360k but the trained model on WebFace600k is missing. It is very likely that a ResNet100 trained on WebFace600k will outperform the current published models.     Do you have plans of training a ResNet100 on WebFace600k?    Thanks :)  Julio

"Hi, I've read some discussion(  about pytorch checkpoint. The running mean/var of BN layer seems update twice when checkpoint is used in training. The way to make batch statistic updating correct is changing momentum to (1 - sqrt(1- original momentum)).   In the recognition project, It seems that the checkpoint is simply used without changing BN momentum. Will this affect the model training? Is it necessary to change momentum manually? @anxiangsir "
"With lower version of Pytorch(1.6.0 for example), problem occurs when using exported ONNX model to inference with a dynamic input.  `2022-07-19 17:04:28.618850992    When input shape is dynamic (32, 256, 12, 12), the destined shape fails to become (32,256,144) and remains (1,256,144).    Pytorch 1.11.0 fixed this problem. For lower version users, using torch.reshape instead of flatten enables a correct conversion.  Original Code (recognition/arcface_torch/backbones/vit.py):  `x = self.proj(x).flatten(2).transpose(1, 2)`  Use Reshape:  `x = self.proj(x)`  `batch_size, channels, height, width = x.shape`  `x = torch.reshape(x, (batch_size, channels, height*width))`  `x = x.transpose(1,2)`    It passes the onnx_helper check and passes the MFR online test.

Everything is on the title :D
The face recognition accuracy decreases because of face angles and this is the biggest hindrance. If a highly accurate Face Frontalization is developed this can solve the problem permanently. This is a no brainer. I would suggest the owners of the repo to move into this direction. 
"Thanks for your great work. I notice that the synthetics dataset that your train the face alignment model has 70 landmark but the ResNet50d model only outputs 68 of them, missing the 2 pupil centers. Can you give a pre-trained model that contains 70 landmarks including 2 pupil centers for a more comprehensive downstream usage？Thanks."

@yingfeng  大佬你好，就是我是一名大二学生，然后是在中北大学的robomaster战队里负责用神经网络识别装甲板实现自动瞄准，不过就是之前我用yolo系列训练出来的模型最后实际测试时得到的bbox和装甲板的轮廓并不能很好的拟合，导致后续使用pnp进行姿态解算时会有较大误差，所以我想将传统yolo的数据集格式改为用四个角点的归一化坐标，现在的数据集格式是像这样：1 0.673029 0.373564 0.678429 0.426232 0.830433 0.401262 0.824525 0.351212，第一个数字是类别id，后面八个数字是归一化后的装甲板的四个角点坐标，之前我使用yolov5-face已经训练出来一个可以直接定位装甲板四个角点的模型，效果如下：  !   然后很早之前就想尝试一些其他的人脸检测模型对比一下关键点定位精度，最开始是想用retinaface，但是当时也是因为数据集使用的widerface，我标注的yolo格式不能直接用于训练，当时也想过离线数据转换，就是写一个脚本将yolo格式转化为widerface格式，不过由于忙其他事一直没什么时间，后来就看到了scrfd这个模型，在人脸检测的速度和精度上都有不错的表现，而且使用的mmdet框架训练，注册机制对于修改模型很方便，但是现在我同样遇到了数据集格式转化的问题  # 0--Parade/0_Parade_marchingband_1_849.jpg 1024 1385  449.00000 330.00000 571.00000 479.00000 488.90601 373.64301 0.00000 542.08899 376.44199 0.00000 515.03101 412.82999 0.00000 485.17401 425.89301 0.00000 538.35699 431.49100 0.00000  这是在你们提供的标签文件中的一部分，按照你们README.md里所说的，前四个应该是左上和右下点的坐标，后面依次是5个关键点的坐标，而且每个点之间用0.00000隔开，就是这里我有疑问，因为在后面的部分中有些时候0.00000有变为-1.00000或者1.00000，如下图：  !   所以我想请教一下你们0.00000还有-1.00000和1.00000分别代表什么意思，而且还有个问题就是我想实现多个装甲板的分类的话是否需要改动模型结构，之前使用yolov5face只需要更改yaml中的nc和names就行，希望大佬能不吝赐教！

您好，我用多卡训练partialFC分类层，之前用50万分类时，四张显卡占用显存基本一致。但是当分类增加到116万时，有两张显卡的占用就特别的高(25G)，另外两张卡占用7G左右。这两张占用较多显存的卡分到的分类每个ID图片数量较多，平均50张，剩下两张占用很少显存的显卡分到的分类每个ID只有两三张图片，这种会造成各个显卡占用不均吗？

"The SimSwap uses insightface and requires to download antelope.zip, and obviously provides a link to a proper model. Insightface as a default now uses buffalo_l ; I would want to test how it would work with this model. However, I can't find a link to buffalo_l models; could you provide one?"
"As it is designed, learning rate raises up linearly in the warmup stage and decreases exponentially in training stage.  During warmup stage, the loss would first decrease before it increases with the growing of learning rate.  The optimal loss pattern is that it will reach minima just at the time when learning rate finishes warming up.  However, recently I found the loss bouncing back so quick when I transferred the training from a 8gpu machine to a 4gpu machine (the sum cuda memory is approximately same).  Is this unexpected loss pattern related to number of GPUs?  Are there any parameters I could adjust?  !   "
您好，最近使用您工程里的VIT模型代码，训练了一版人脸识别模型，但是在我自己的测试集上，比相同数据训练出来的resnet50模型低了10个点左右。参数配置全部是按照工程里设置的，想问下您在训练时是否使用了预训练模型，或者有什么训练的小技巧？
"Hi @QingpingZheng, seems like requirements.txt  is missing from the repo."
"I am trying to make an inference using the partialfc r100 and r50 models, and I have downloaded them from:       I see that the models are named `16_**` and `16*`    Is it safe to assume that these are fp16 models?    So, in line:         should I be setting it as:         is this the correct way to set the model for inference on partialfc using the given pretrained model?    thank you for the awesome package.

"Hi.    Thanks for this awesome repository and all your work involved in it.    I was wondering if it is possible to fine-tune your models using four channel images. In my particular case, I've already manipulated the data in order to have four channels instead of the classic three. Also, I've modified the image_iter.py so the ""return io.DataBatch(...)"" in the next(self) function, returns a batch_data of shape (batch_size, 4, 112, 112) instead of (batch_size, 3, 112, 112).    I've succesfully performed a lot of fine-tune with three channels data and your models previously, but when I try to execute this ""four channels image"" fine-tune I get the following error message:     MXNetError: Check failed: assign(&dattr, vec.at(i)): Incompatible attr in node  at 0-th output: expected [32,4,112,112], got [32,3,112,112].     Also, if I modify the ""self.provide_data"" to have data_shape (4,112,112) instead of (3,112,112), I recieve the following error message:    MXNetError: Check failed: assign(&dattr, vec.at(i)): Incompatible attr in node  at 0-th output: expected [64,3,3,3], got [64,4,3,3].     So I was wondering if it is possible to fine-tune your models with four channel data or it's just impossible and I have to train a model from scratch.    Finally, I was able to performe four channel data training from scratch (no pretrained model) with this modifications with no problem, but another issue appears. After verbose batches (i.e. evaluation time) the training is interrumpted and the following message shows up:    MXNetError: Shape of unspecifie arg: conv0_weight changed. This can cause the new executor to not share parameters with the old one. Please check for error in network.If this is intended, set partial_shaping=True to suppress this warning.    I'm presuming this is because my .bin files for evaluations where created from three channels images. Should I add a fourth channel to them also? Or am I missing something and it's possible to train with four channel data and validate on three channel data?    I know my questions are extensive and might be confusing, so let me know if there is any specific information I could provide to help me solve them.   Thanks in advance."
"@jiankangdeng   Does VPL training give improvements over Arcface on large training sets?    When we train with 3 Million identities, we observed that only 4% of identities are VPL trained (4% identities have lambda=0.15, rest 96% identities have lambda=0) at allowed_delta=200.  In other words, only 4% identities use features saved from past to compute variational prototype , for the rest class centre is used as it is.    Is VPL effective when such low percentage of identities have valid features in queue?  How do we increase this percentage?    Observation:  We experimented with the effect of allowed_delta with on MS1MV3 with 128x4 batch size without momentum.  at allowed_delta=100, around 25% of identities are VPL trained, for the rest lambda=0.  at allowed_delta=200, around 50% of identities are VPL trained  We observed slightly better accuracies at allowed_delta=100.     vpl code from insightface repo uses a concept called VPL momentum. What is its effect? How to use VPL momentum effectively? Batch size reduces by 50% when VPL momentum is used.    "

When importing insightface I'm keep having   'libcudart.s.0.11.0 : cannot open shared object file : No such file or directory ' error  I think this is because of CUDA version.     So my question is what version of insightface is using under CUDA 10 version? 
"Hello,    I would like start testing and using _insightface_ for face recognition. At the main repository page no tutorial or guideline and there are many external links for other repositories and pages. This confuse me a lot.

I wanna create my recognition benchmark using insightface/recognition/arcface_mxnet/common/build_eval_pack.py.   As i understood i need to have pairs_label.txt to do this. My data set is masked LFW so the pairs_label.txt from orignal LFW is what i'm looking for. Where can i find this file?  
I use the scrfd_2.5g_bnkps model. how can I get 5 keypoints from it? Now the model only outputs bbox for image. Thanks
I guess it is in my server. It takes about a week. How long do you generally take? Is there a way to make this process faster??

"Hi, I've read your recent work VPL and tried to use it in our project, I implemented Arcface with VPL in Mxnet and I have met several questions:  1. In the memory injection part,  the Dimensional of embedding in Memory bank (M) is significantly different with the weight (W, which is [0,1] ). In order to do the injection, I normalized M before adding it to W. And the final weight = **Norm( 0.15 * Norm(M)  + 0.85 * W )**  Is this assumption matches your implementation of VPL ?  2. Is there any ideas of hyper-parameter settings in different data distribution ? Which hyper-parameter is more important, t or M_ratio (which is decided by t)? Because in my datasets, I have to set t =2000 to reach M_ratio = 40% and memory bank might contain features from early steps.    Thanks !"

I've tried to apply cudnn 8.1 from nvidia site using tar installation.  I've tried to install cudnn using anaconda installation `conda install -c conda-forge cudnn`  Moreover, if i'm not installing cudnn and cudatoolkit inside anaconda  using conda install it won't find my /usr/local/cuda installation. Probably problem with anaconda environment or so.  I can't try to use cuda 10.2 since i'm using laptop with 3070 and 10.2 doesn't support 3070.  I'm actually out of ideas right now. Only if use dlib's landmarks instead, which is kinda slower. Any suggestions?"

I evaluated the pretrained pytorch R100 partialFC model against the equivalent Mxnet model and saw that the Mxnet model does better on IJB-C. Furthermore, when I try to retrain the partialFC model using the arcface_torch module, I still see the same result (Mxnet < Pytorch).     Were you able to replicate the Mxnet result with Pytorch? If so, can you share the training strategy you followed to make that model.    Thank you again for the excellent work. "

"Hi! I'm testing your new SCRFD face detector and have noticed some issues with onnx inference code and network outputs:    1. In    line 275 you are filtering `bboxes`, but later at line 278 you return `det`, so `max_num` parameter have no effect and may cause exceptions.    2. Later at line   you are calling detector without providing input shape, which wont work with model having dynamic shape. However it won't be an issue when called from `face_analysis.py`     3. I have noticed that detector returns very low scores or even fails on faces occupying >40% of image, it's especially visible for square shaped images, when there can't be provided additional padding during resize process. Also I have noticed that in such cases accuracy increases when lowering detection size (i.e. 480x480), and decreases when increasing it (i.e 1024x1024).       Here is an example of detection at 640x640 scale:   !   Original image size is 1200x1200.  As you can see when detection is run with resize to 640x640 score is 0.38  For `480x480` score is `0.86`, and for `736x736` score is `0.07`.  Same behavior is noticed for both `scrfd_10g_bnkps` and `scrfd_2.5g_bnkps` models.  In some cases it might be fixed by adding fixed padding around image, but it might lead to decreased accuracy for other image types, so it can't be applied by default.    BTW: Thanks for your great work!"

"Hi,         when training arcface-torch, you guys convert last fc layer to fp32.    why do you convert last layer to fc32?"

您好我在训练启动时发生了错误能否得到您的帮助  !   
     Can you please provide google drive link to download?
"while i trained the arcface pytorch with 2 gpus , which used the command below , it worked fine :  `python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=""127.0.0.1"" --master_port=1234 train.py`    but failed by set the nproc_per_node=4 , my command is :  `python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=""127.0.0.1"" --master_port=1234 train.py`    the error is:       @anxiangsir do you have any idea ? great thanks  !

"when running insightface's vectorizing functions with `joblib.Parallel` jobs, they complete, but dont return (hangs). Found  , says that it's due to MKL internal bug.    I'm running this script `MXNET_CPU_WORKER_NTHREADS=4 python run.py --fpath ./imgs.txt --parallel 1`, tried to tweak ENV var, but no result.    Please advise how to parallel insightface's vectorizing using shared model memory as in multiprocessing model per CPU consumes a lot of RAM. Thought that joblib `sharedmem` should solve it, but no luck    Source  "
"Hi, i'm new to programming    1. Did i understand correctly that recognition module is for comparing 2 photos and answering if it is one man on photos?  2. How to run recognition module? I don't see test.py in folder    Thanks!"
"The original article says that the learning rate for the Glint360 dataset divided by 10 at 200k, 400k, 500k, 550k iterations  and finish at 600K iterations. Are there any recommendations for a strategy to reduce LR for datasets of 1 million, 10 million, 100 million identities? Thanks in advance for your reply"
"  I found in the code , that the backbone in wrapped by DistributedDataParallel , so the model will  sync different gradient in different gpus  ,  but conversely  the module_partial_fc isn't wrapped by DistributedDataParallel ,  will the center's weight in different gpu be different  ? and should the center be the same in different gpus ?     @anxiangsir     "
"In the first stage of backward,     To monitor changes of training loss, I use    `y = grad * logits`  `loss1 = y.sum()`  `loss1.backward()`    to replace it.   No matter the nember of training data, after dozens of epochs, loss always becomes negative.  !   "

"For training ArcFace models by millions of IDs, we may meet some time efficiency problems.     =====  **_P1: There are too many classes that my GPUs can not handle._**    Solutions:    1) To reduce memory usage of the classification layer,    and   can be the good ideas.    2) Enable FP16 can further reduce the GPU memory usage and also get acceleration on modern NVIDIA GPUs. For example, we can enable fp16 training by a simple ``fp16-scale`` parameter:             or change the following setting in partial-fc MXNet implementation.       3) Use distributed training.    =====  **_P2. The training dataset is too huge, io cost is high which leads to very low training speed._**    Solutions:    1) Sequential data loader instead of random access.           Right now the default face recognition datasets(*.rec) are indexed key-value databases, called `MXIndexedRecordIO`. So the data loader is required to randomly access the items in these datasets while doing the training. The performance is acceptable only if the data is located on ram-filesystem or very fast SSD.  For general hard disks, we must use an alternative method to avoid random access.        a. Use   to convert any indexed '.rec' dataset to a shuffled sequential one called `MXRecordIO`    b. In  , set `is_shuffled_rec=True` in config file to use the converted shuffled dataset. Please check `get_face_image_iter()` function in `image_iter.py` for detail information.    c. Shuffled dataset-loader requires sequential scanning only, and provides data shuffling in a small in-memory buffer.    d. Shuffled dataset can also benefit from the c++ runtime of MXNet record reader which accelerates the image processing.    =====  Any question or discussion can be left in this thread.    "

Searching around in Google brought me some concepts about image blur level, contrast, illumination, sharpness,...too many things and I'm not sure which one is bad for face extractor, which one can bring the best performance.  What is your idea about it? Do you have any experiments with image enhancement methods for face recognition? Which one brought the best performance?    Thanks,  Can   "

When I list the last 10 layers in the pre-trained network I see the following:     I need to remove the fully connected layers and I am not sure what do `pre_fc1_weight`,  `pre_fc1_bias`, and   `pre_fc1_output` do? Is there a sketch of the network available anywhere? Are these layers fully connected layers?  I would really appreciate if you could help me with my questions.    Thanks  "

"Hello,    First of all thank you for your great work on face algorithms that has been very useful to me over the years.    As I wanted to use retinaface in tf and couldnt find a satisfactory implementation, I recently converted your model to tensorflow2.0+ :       I have achieved almost the same accuracy on widerface, though inference is a little bit slower.    Since there are quite a few questions about tf/keras implementations being available, I thought I could leave this issue here. If this is against your policy, please let me know and I will remove the issue."

Is there any preprocessing i can do like resizing and cropping which can help in improving the detection accuracy?"

"Hi,    why do you use the following points for image alignment when doing preprocessing for training with arcface loss?    `arcface_src = np.array([    [38.2946, 51.6963],    [73.5318, 51.5014],    [56.0252, 71.7366],    [41.5493, 92.3655],    [70.7299, 92.2041] ], dtype=np.float32 )`    It seems that first of all eyes and mouth points do not have the same y coordinates. Furthermore when doing mirroring along the y axis (which is a common data augmentation operation) the position of the landmarks changes slightly which could have a bad influence on training?    So where do these coordinates come from and why are they not designed such that the mirroring transformation does not change the landmark locations?    Kind regards,    Christian"
"Hello  How are you?  Thanks for contributing the _Arcface_ paper and this project.  I have a trouble to set the scale parameter s in training an _Arcface_ model.  I used _Resnet50_ and _ms1m_ dataset.  You and many developers use _s_=64.0 but I could not find how to set the scale parameter _s_.  I read a paper for _AdaCos_.  As you know, _AdaCos_ uses _s=sqrt(2)*ln(classes-1)_ as the scale parameter in the fixed parameter mode.  For _ms1m_ dataset (85K classes), _s_ is about 16.06.  I would like to hear your opinion for this.  Thank you."

"Hi,    I'm am trying to use face biometrics to identify peoples. I have a few questions:    1- How can we use multiple images of a person to better identification?  * One way is using   classifier to find the closest embedding to the input embedding.  * Another heuristic way that I'm not sure about it, but it results better accuracy is that I choose one of  the embeddings as (the best) a baseline embedding for a person and use that embedding for identification. I choose an embedding which has the closest average distance to all other embeddings of the same person (If we have two embeddings for one person, we choose one of them randomly). I think this is very crazy. When we choose one embedding as the best, other embeddings are not useful anymore.     2- What is the best threshold for identification. I mean how should I choose a threshold for similarity to get a 95% accuracy. If I set it 0.6 False-Positive rate is high (false person is accepted) and when it is 0.8 False-Negative rate is high (true person is rejected). I know that it depends on application, but after trying different thresholds in different places, with different peoples, cameras, and hardware resource (different frame rated) I still cannot get a fix number for my application which is using face biometrics for access control with a 95% accuracy."
您好，阅读了源码，我发现在用默认设置训练的时候，发现数据增强只用了随机镜像翻转。然后我看别人的人脸识别训练代码时候也发现数据增强这块往往用的很少（比如颜色抖动阿，mixup等等）。 请问是为什么呢

"I went over the README and couldn't find clear explanation on the face alignment process (which is a preprocessing for the training).   I will assume this is a relevant script - ""src/align/align_celeb.py"". Am i right ?     However, this script has dependencies - the main one is MTCNN tensorflow version. Can you please mention the exact version of MTCNN you used (with url) ?   There are many versions out there, i have seen your note :  ""Any public available MTCNN can be used to align the faces, and the performance should not change.""

"I am running the pre-trained model RetinaFace-R50 and with my mac pro it takes about 4s (0.25fps) to process an image (only inference time, w/o loading/pre/post-processing).    The paper says that the bigger RetinaFace model, with ResNet152 backbone, runs in. 75 ms (13fps). This is more than 50 times faster than what I experience with a CPU and on a smaller model. Is this normal?     To draw an analogy, using the GPU on the MobileNet-0.25 model, the execution is about 12 times faster than with the CPU. However in my case I am using the CPU on a smaller model and, despite that, it is 50 times slower.     From the paper:   <img width=""346"" alt=""Screenshot 2020-04-17 at 10 59 30"" src=""     "

Thank you for sharing the project.  I ran a verification on a pre-trained model as written in the README.md file:    $INSIGHTFACE/src/eval/verification.py    and the scores:    [agedb_30]XNorm: 22.654594  [agedb_30]Accuracy: 0.00000+-0.00000  [agedb_30]Accuracy-Flip: 0.98250+-0.00712  Max of [agedb_30] is 0.98250    Can you explained what is the difference between the scores & especially between Accuracy and Accuracy-Flip?
您好，请问CFP-FP人脸数据集标准的测试方法是什么？我是从 
人脸检测对齐使用两种不同的mtcnn实现  1.第一种完全基于opencv实现mtcnn  2.第二种使用insightface中deploy目录下的mtcnn实现    数据集：  1.自己制作的小的数据集（6000张测试数据，400张底图）    比对：  使用欧式距离作为比对结果    阈值：1.24    结果：  1.两种实现，最后结果差异在5个像素以内  2.设置相同的阈值（1.24），对同样的数据集进行测试，最后精确率和召回率会相差很大  3..使用第一种mtcnn实现做人脸检测，精确率很低但是召回率很高      使用第二种mtcnn实现做人脸检测，召回率低但是精确率高    做了如下尝试  1.使用第一种mtcnn实现做人脸检测，并不断的调低阈值，最终能够得到一个接近第二种实现的结果    问题：  人脸检测的结果是否会影响到阈值的选择？  是否更换人脸检测模块？  需要重新测试获取一个合适的阈值？  为什么人脸检测结果的差异会导致阈值发生偏移呢？      
"The readme is out of line with the project, for example in readme it says to perform the training as follows:    `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0,1,2,3' python -u train.py --network r100 --loss arcface --dataset emore`    but the option --loss and --dataset doesn´t exists, in fact now is --loss-type and --data-dir, and looking at the code, I realized that these options work completely differently from the previous ones."

When i use four cameras my cpu usage is 90% and i couldnt to add more cameras.  How i can to use 20cameras for this project?    My system info is :gpu 1080ti,cpu core i7 9700k,32gb ram.  Isn't my hardware enough for this purpose?  How do I choose the right hardware?  Is retinaface a better target for my project?  How to run the whole process on gpu?  Please help me"
"Hi all,    I'm using tools from this repo   to convert resnet50 insightface model to caffe.    I've tested the pretrained model, the conversion is success and the result is exactly the same.    However, when I tried it out on my trained model, the inference output is completely different. The command used to train my model is `python -u train.py --network r50 --loss arcface --dataset emore`.    Compared with the original setting, I had two modifications. First, I changed the value of config.ckpt_embedding to False in config.py, in order to save the last fc layer for future finetune. And I pruned fc7 layer afterward and the model's performance is as expected. The second difference is that I changed the dataset.emore.image_shape in config file to (64,64,3) to make the model accept 64x64 face images. And after the execution of json2prototxt.py, I manually changed the input shape to 1, 3, 64, 64. After generate the caffemodel, I can do inference, but the output is not the same as mxnet.    I suspect that changing the input size may lead to the conversion failure. But I have no idea how to solve this problem. Any idea how to make it work for 64x64 input image? @nttstar @GarrickLin    Many thanks."
"the version of mxnet is mxnet-cu100,  the version of cuda is cuda-10, When I run the scripts    of train.py ,the process of trainning will kill itself,why? Is it possible for the bug of mxnet-cu100?"
"Hi, I apply insightface for face recognition with my own dataset by simply add 2 fc layers and output the index of the class.  Firstly I trained it on mxnet, fixed the feature network(pretrained model: r100), only finetune that 2 additional fc layers. Then I re-implemented it with tensorflow, the parameters and optimizer and initialization is the same. However, I cannot reproduce the same result as on mxnet.  Any suggestion, please? Is there any detail could I ignored?  Thank you."

Good morning. We are working on your arcface.  This time we are going to megaface. We downloaded the megaface from washington university. But the dataset at washington is not refined. The arcface paper seems to have refined the megaface. Can I share the refined megaface?
Hi. I've downloaded both AgeDB-30 by yours and the original AgeDB by iBUG. How ever the AgeDB-30 is aligned already and I wanna do align by myself. I've looked into AgeDB-30 and the original AgeDB but I couldn't find out the relationship between this two.    So my question is that what's the relationship between the two db? Is there any private dataset in the  AgeDB-30 ?

However, it starts with a bad accuracy in train (I can understand that is because the fc7 layer was removed) but it also have a poor accuracy (60%) in verification with the lfw dataset, which should be quite better, because it is using the embedding layer and not the fc7.

"Hi,    Thanks for this great work.    I am not able to understand some of the code (and mostly because of no background in mxnet; I do know tensorflow)         I believe fc7 is the output layer of your network.     In the very last line in the above code snippet you do `fc7 = fc7 + body`.    Does this mean that you are updating the weights of fc7 ?    It seems that fc7 is a trainable layer i.e. its weights would be updated by the backprop. Why do you add 'body' to fc7 ?    Would appreciate if you can help it understand.

Using the threshold of `0.5` as indicated in the paper's figure label gave me 388 faces as shown below:    From the paper 900 faces  !     From the code on this repository using threshold of `0.5` and `net3` ""only"" 388 faces  !     2. What is the trade-off of the `treshold` itself, how (de) increasing it will change the capacity of the detection?    3. On the paper you have compared a 68-landmark model. Are you going to publish pre-trained model with 68 landmarks?    Thanks in advance."
"I want to finetune this model, because 'label' contains 'gender and age'. I wonder what the 'label' format is in the .lst file."

Thanks very much!
"Hi,  Thanks for your great contribution. I am a researcher that want to reproduce your results, but I didn't find in the code of RetinaFace project the Dense Regression Loss from the differentiable 3D mesh renderer. It seems its function is imported inside symbol_common:   from rcnn.PY_OP import rpn_3d_mesh  but this file (rpn_3d_mesh) is missing in this repository. Is it possible to share this file publicly?  Also, is the pretrained model of Retinaface trained with this dense regression loss from the 3D mesh renderer?"
what tools do you use to label the landmark point 
"Hello!    I've tried several images to go through RetinaFace/test.py. I found that for a group photo, it's easy for RetinaFace to detect all faces:    !     But when it comes to a single big face in one image as below (which in fact is a crop from a big photo), RetinaFace either fails to detect any faces, or returns a wrong bounding box or landmark.    !   !   !     I think that this is because some parameters (scale, network, decay4 or something) should be adapt for detecting a big face. In MTCNN, I can feed the whole image into R-Net directly to solve this problem, but I have no idea what to do with RetinaFace. Can anybody help me on this question?    Thank you!"

Has anyone tried insightface inference to run on android?
"Hi,    I found that the whole process of  retinaface inference is quite slow, because the mxnet.ndarray operations execute in asynchronous mode. So that for the first time you run ndarray op (`scores = net_out[idx].asnumpy()` at line 221 of retinaface.py), GPU/CPU must wait for the other computations. Here, it seem that it wait for the foward command.     Do you have any idea to change this by other one, in ordet to reduce the retinaface inference time ? "

"Hi,  Do you have the loss curve over the training set of the vggface2 dataset ?   I'm currently training your model on the vggface2 dataset and my error after 5 epochs is around 0.03. However the the performance of that model over the some tests from the same training set is not good.   Thanks !"
"Dear @nttstar @yingfeng @jiankangdeng,    Thank you for your wondeful works.    I have one question about evaluation on IJB-C.  Now, I try to use RetinaFace-R50 to detect face.   I found that there have some templates (image group of certain ID) in which RetinaFace-R50 fails to detect all images. So, if you failed to detect all face regions in one template (image group of certain ID), how did you treat this case in calculate ROC? Ignore this template or count this template to false positive or label manully the image which RetinaFace-R50 fails to give any face?    Looking forward to your reply.  Thank you in advance.  "

您们好，我可以请教两大问题吗？  1. 目前的环境是 Centos7+python2.7+mxnet+cpu。于是想将代码中有关的GPU改成CPU，改着改着，错误百出。所以请问作者有何解决方案。  2.目前想用mtcnn（人脸检测）+insightface（人脸识别），来实现人脸识别功能。。但是无法从根目录《readme》查找的执行程序的入口。。请问最新版本中，哪个文件是生成底图的特征值；哪个文件是基于欧氏距离比对图形的。    Lastly，I am  in shanghai too。 Thanks!

"Hi all,    I'm trying to finetune the pretrained mobilefacenet model with triplet loss on my private dataset, which is quite small (250 images from 25 identities).    But when I finetune it, it seems that the per_batch_size and triplet_bag_size is causing the training to fail, no matter how small I set those two parameters. I'm wondering what does the triplet_bag_size parameter stand for and is it possible to do finetune on such small datasets, if not, what is the smallest dataset size that is acceptable for finetuning?    Many thanks!"

"Hi~    Thank you for the amazing work.    The facescrub_noise.txt lists 605 files.  We found that there are 24 overlapped files between the noise list and the feature list (facescrub_uncropped_features_list.json for run_experiment.py) for megaface validation.    We are curious about the improvement introduced by removing the megaface noise since the improvement is significant (>15%) as stated in the paper, while the improvement is limited in our case (<1%).  Is the number of the overlapped files 24 or up to 605?    Thank you.  "
"Dear all!  I want to fine-tune a face recognition model for Asian, and I plan to use author's pre-trained model(ResNet50-arcface-msra1m) as base model and to fine-tune it  on glint-asian dataset. My confusion is that how to evaluate this asian model? use LFW/CFP/AgeDB? I think if my target is to recognize Asian people, just using LFW/CFP/AgeDB as validation dataset is not fair. Am I correct? or it is not necessary to use a validation set which just contains Asian people? or I   can split glint-asian dataset to new train_set and val_set? which one is best? Any other idea? Appreciate any reply!"

Hi I am going to be testing insight face at an upcoming event and I was wondering what would be the best  strategy for implementing insightface. So far I have thought of the following:    1. Run mtcnn detector on RTSP stream along with tracking and send 5 cropped faces per tracker id to a queue.  2. Run the client app to fetch the data from queue and send the cropped face to the insightface inference server and calculate the distance and update the database.    Please share your thoughts regarding this architecture and suggest improvements to implement insightface in the best possible manner.    Thanks.

May I request the corresponding names of those celebrities in MS1M-ArcFace-v2?  Since I know there are some overlaps between ms1m and LFW, I would like to clean that a bit.

Thank you for your great work!    Issue #24 shows that MS1M Arcface already remove the overlapped data from FaceScrub.  We would like to know the overlapped data of LFW is also removed or not.    Thank you.
"Hi,    In the below link, you can find the code I work on.       I want to evaluate face identification performance for this project. I used uVa-Nemo database for this and aligned the images with dlib(not with mtcnn as in your project), their size is 112*112. I get representation vectors from fc1 layer for this.  The model is : model-r50-am-lfw.  After that I use 4 Fold Cross Validation process to see the performance for identification under distortion.  I also did the same process with resnet50_ft.caffemodel(trained on VGGFace2).    The problem is that the performance is lower than resnet50_ft. But in your paper, you have better results than VGGFace2.    What is wrong here? If you have an idea, please share."

I have ported the models to TVM but how do i call functions in the original code like get_input and get_feature in TVM to get the vector of the face ?    Thanks.
Is there any implementation of arcface loss function that can be used with siamese architecture?
Is there any chance of improving the speed of get_input method as it seems to be taking 300 ms each time..    Thanks.

"Hi, thanks for your great work. I would like to ask some easy questions:    1. I've downloaded MS1M-ArcFace( which is 85k identites, 5.8M, 112x112 images). Are these the images that have already been preprocessed by MTCNN? And did you directly use these images for training? I have this question since the images still seem to have some background behind.    2. When I use dataloader to load the images, what are the mean and std should I use to normalize them? Are them all [0.5,0.5,0.5]?    Thanks in advance since I kept trying to use the orginal ResNet34(imported from pytorch) +center loss and with my own cropped face dataset, I only got 98.6% on LFW.

"Hi ，thanks for sharing your work.I want to try to finetune my model by freezon the layers before the layer of  ""fc7"",what I should do and how to modify the codes.Can you help me?Thx a lot!"
"Hello,  In this page,   you report the performance of different models on different databases.    Question 1: For LFW and CFP-FP databases, is the % that you get TAR ? (And in this case, how about the associated FAR ?)    Question 2: For CFP-FP, we compare between frontal face vs. profile face. It is difficult to apply the face alignment on the later. How do you do in this case ? Or simply you take directly the image of database and compute the embedding then the score (because I see that in this CFP database, all images are already cropped around the faces)    Thanks"
"Dear @yingfeng, @nttstar, @yuzhichang,  I have a face data set with the following format:     Would you please kindly guide me to how I can train your models (e.g., with ArcFace Loss) on my own data set?  "
Currently insightface does not support python3?Whether there is any plan to support later

"Hi,    I wanted to know what the optimal image size for high accuracy and speed for profile pictures to predict age and gender.  ex: is 150*150px image accurate enough 85% of the time?    Or a link to the paper that the model is based on?    Cheers!"
"Hi, I am trying to deploy the age and gender model using the mxnet-model-server on an ec2 instance with 8 CPUs (m5.4xlarge).    I am facing 2 issues:  1. The response time for images with size > 300px*300px is 10 times slower than that with 200px*200px.   2. Also I expected ~ 2x the throughput with 2x cores. But i dont see any improvement.    I am trying to understand if there is something in the model that is causing the CPU to slow down with increased throughput?     Any help appreciated. Thanks!  "
"Thanks for Sharing! @nttstar   About the glint-challenge i am puzzled for the result.  i use the  LResNet100E-IR,ArcFace@ms1m-refine-v2 model and generate the feature file for glint test data, the result are as flows.     1.Identification: 0.70841   TPR@FPR=1e-3  2.Verification:0.39500    TPR@FPR=1e-9    the result is lower than most of the submitted algorithms, therefore, there is any mistake or i need to train the algorithm  with deep glint training dataset?

您好，请问您默认的训练epoch是多少次，训练的多长时间，谢谢。
"Thanks for sharing the code, but I am confused about one issue. Is the input image to the trained face recognition model in RGB or BGR?    The input here   is RGB,  but the input here   is BGR.   Which one is correct? I.e. which color channel order was used during training?     Ps. actually #L28 is not able to execute as the color channel is not swapped from index 2 to index 0 yet.     Thanks in advance! "

"Hi guys, nice project.   I made a minimalistic insightface repack that works for inference out of the box.  Original code is quite bloated and hard to navigate if all you want is to do inference with pre-trained models. I ommited anything that is not related to inference and provide some additional error handling and a Jupyter Notebook usage example.       Mind to include it into third-party reimplemetations list?"

f2 = model.get_feature(img)  As f2 is  a 512-dimensional zero vector！！！！  what is wrong？
can you tell me where the SDU model is?

"For few-shot learning tasks like IDCard Camera face verification(identification), we only have two face images for each person in most cases for training.  Under such situation, metric learning approaches can be tried such as tripletloss.     **STEPS:**    1. Prepare insightface '.rec' dataset from your IDCard/camera face images.  2. Finetuning pretrained models with tripletloss, for example:         We use GPU to do the semi-hard mining so training will be fast.    **RESULTS:**    We have a private IDCard/Camera face image dataset with 220K identities.

1. Download dataset from   (after signup). `msra` is a cleaned subset of MS1M from glint while `celebrity` is the asian dataset.  2. Generate lst file by calling `src/data/glint2lst.py`. For example:       or generate the asian dataset only by:       3. Call face2rec2.py to generate .rec file.  4. Merge the dataset with existing one by calling `src/data/dataset_merge.py` without setting param _model_ which will combine all IDs from those two datasets.      Finally you will get a dataset contains about 180K IDs.    Use `src/eval/gen_glint.py` to prepare test feature file by using pretrained insightface model.    You can also post your private testing results here.
"A new training dataset 'insightv2'(code name _emore_) (still largely based on ms1m) is available at   and   (from @gdshen ) which can achieve a better accuracy easily. I hope anybody who uses _insightface_ can post your training accuracy and detail here to show the strength of our network backbone, dataset and loss function. (Currently I will not provide pretrained models)  (more training dataset contribution is welcome, email me pls~)    The format may like below(take from one of my experiments):  1. dataset:  emore (or faces_ms1m for the old one)  2. network backbone: r50 ( res_unit=3, output=E, emb_size=512, prelu )  3. loss function: arcface(m=0.5)  4. training pipeline:  straightforward (lr drop at 100K, 140K, 160K), batch-size:512  5.

请教作者两个问题：    1、如题，ViT的训练为什么没使用Dali加载数据？是会影响效果吗？    2、如果我只有单机8卡的机器，训练ViT是否使用了梯度累计对结果大概有多大影响？根据作者的实验，Single-Host GPU训练实验中，ViT-T使用了梯度累计而ViT-B没使用梯度累计，相比64卡训练差异都比较小（MFR-ALL分别为92.04→92.24和97.16→97.42），从这个结果如何看代梯度累计的影响呢？    因计算资源较少，希望从作者的实验中多看到一些结论。非常感谢！

The network predicts both the **3D vertexs** in the world space and **2D landmarks** on the image plane, but the ground-truth only provides the 3D points (verts3d) and camera extrinsic (R_t).

As per this loss function the target logit is set to `cos(theta_{yi} + margin)` scaled appropriately at the end and the rest is as is.

"Hello,    I am training   but do not use dali, DistributedSampler, or DataLoaderX to wrap the  MXFaceDataset since I only have one machine. A simple torch Dataloader is used to wrap the MXFaceDataset.

Hence, I run the   to do a pre-shuffling so I can set the shuffle arg in Dataloader False.    To be compatible with the code in  , I do a bit change in the  . To be specific, MXRecordIO is replaced with MXIndexedRecordIO to produce both idx and rec files. That's all of the change.    The training of the FC layer (93431 classes output) goes very fast and smooth. However, at the very middle of the second epoch, the loss surges. The same case happens at the middle of the third, forth, epochs, causing a strange cyclic loss pattern.    I have checked the learning rate, different optimizers, the images and labels after running the   shuffling. Nothing went wrong. Then I redo the   many times to create different training data streams, but the loss pattern persists. The cross entropy loss always surges at the very middle of each epochs.

"Hello!  Thanks for your awesome work and detailed instructions.  I followed the configuration  ](  to train the model and made some changes.         - `save_step`, `start_step`, `fc_path`, `opt_path`, `pretrain_model_path`：These parameters are designed to allow the model to continue training after the program is disconnected.  - Other parameters are unchanged.        The code is modified only according to the new parameters added above.             But when I train from scratch, these extra parameters and code are not needed.    I tried to train a few epochs. Part of the training logs are as follows.（the first epoch）             I compared this result with the  ](  and found that my results were much worse.    - My loss only dropped to 30 in the first epoch but the official one can drop to 14.

I even tried the face alignment code from  , but I cannot reproduce the same alignment.    (Mine)  !   (Yours)  !     Can you provide me with more information on which alignment you used at the time?

"Hello,  I'm currently experimenting with robust face recognition algorithms like Subcenter-Arcface. Can anyone, who has the Celeb-500k dataset, share it via torrents?   Thanks so much in advance!"
"Hi there, i found an interesting issue in `glint360k` dataset.  According to your code in  , indices within `[17091658., 17451890.]` stores `identity`, and `[1., 17091657.]` stores `image`. But it seems that label information stored in `identity` **occationally** doesn't match with labels in `image`.    For example, when i use     i get `[16880352 16880388]`, which i think it means images with idx in `range(16880352, 16880388)` belongs to a **single** person, but actually they're NOT!    Here's the code:       This happens often to latter indexed identities, which I think is misleading. Since indices within `[0., 17091657.]` already provided adequate information, why appending it with those confusion data?"

Does anyone experience the same issue or have any solution? thanks.

"Hi, first I want to say thanks for your sharing and effort to make glint360 dataset available.  We've downloaded the torrent and got 7 files, the first :  glint360k/glint360k_00 is gzip type file.  When we try to open it using the command you gave or others we get error, problem with EOF.    The rest are data files, are those files suppose to be used directly with ""unpack_glint360k.py""? or open in a different way?    Thanks a lot.          "

你好，请问有106关键点对应的序号吗，尤其是两眼中心对应的序号。
"After training IResnet-100 with Glint360k, I did validation of IJB-B and IJB-C.    TPR@FPR=1e-4 of IJB-C was 97.10% (closed to your Partial-FC paper result = 97.30%).     But TPR@FPR=1e-6 of IJB-C was too low(82%) compared to other models(92.0%) trained with different datasets (ex: MS1MV2)    You know, the result of TPR(@FPR=1e-4 of IJB-B & IJB-C) has been mainly addressed in recent papers.    What do you think of which result is more relevant in ""NIST FRVT 1:1 rank"" between TPR@FPR=1e-4 and TPR@FPR=1e-6?    Could you share your opinion about this?    Thanks for reading."

"I have to begin with apologize with starting this, because i'm not experienced in working with such tools and CUDA, but I really want to try and I can't do it for like 3 month because of the following issue:  **OSError: libcudart.so.10.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory** when i start any of .py programs inside the folder.  I had installed cuda-10.2 at first, then i thought that it wouldn't work with mxnet101, so I installed cuda-10.1 too and add all of their pathes to library_path. When I had cuda10-2 this error looked like OSError: libcudart.so.**10.1**: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  but now, when I installed 10.1, I still have the same issue, but with libcudart.so.10.0.   I have troubles with installing cuda-10.0, but I also think that it shouldn't work like this, so maybe I failed somewhere, but I can't find where.  I use ubuntu through VirtualBox, so maybe this could be the reason too, but I didn't find out any thoughts about this here.  There is an issue #1022 and i don't know if anyone solved this yet.

"Thanks deepinsight team for the great work! I have a problem about finetuning model.     The ArcLoss introduces a margin to help the embedding model to perform better. However, I already have a pretrained embedding model, and a tiny dataset.  So I should only train the ArcLoss head (except for the embedding model) to recognition the identities of this tiny dataset. In my opinion, I should set `m = 0` so that the output of ArcLoss head is confidence of each identity.    But after I train the arcloss head in this way, the predicted result of arcloss head is much more unstable compared to facenet (based on softmax) and cosface.    Do I have something wrong? And how do I use arcloss to predict the confidence? Thanks a lot."

"Hi all,    I know a few people asked this earlier but none of there solution solves my problem.    The .lst file contains 5880026 lines, which means my dataset contains 5880026 images. And the line's format in .lst file is '1 image_path id' since all images are aligned. ID starts from 0 and all images belong to the same person are listed together. And I run the code use python2.7, not python3.    The time count during the execution is around 0.3s per 1000 images before it counts to 5880000 images. After that, the image count still grows until 5967000 and the time count is around 0.05, which is much less than before.    Any idea why the count is more than actual image count?    Many thanks.  "

In the code here, `recognition/train_parall.py` seems to conform to the description in the article but I see an unexplained variation in `recognition/train.py`... Is there an explanation for the variant in `recognition/train.py`?    This version seems consistent with the article (the `config.loss_s` factor is applied at the end on all the logits):           But this version is weird and unexplained - the logit of the target class is _divided_ by `config.loss_s`, then the margin is applied, then the modified logit is multiplied by `config.loss_s`, while the other logits are not affected by any scaling:         "

您好：  虽然很多人问了这个问题，但是我还是不是很明白  out_list = [mx.symbol.BlockGrad(embedding)]这句话的含义    我认为embedding代表从图像到特征图的过程，如果这部分的梯度被切断，回传的梯度为0  那么该部分就无法从loss中获取回传信息，那里面的参数都不会变化，如何起到训练的作用？如何使该embedding朝着好的方向优化？  换句话说，embedding里的参数是根据什么优化的？    期待您的回答，非常感谢~

"I'm just trying to understand what's behind the ""feature embedding"" term/function:  1.

If when training, the goal is to ""embed"" all face features **in** ANN weights (and have say 10k outputs for 10k persons to classify),  then the ""**embedding**"" already happened during training (which requires lot of passes and samples). So how then the ""feature embedding"" which takes only 17 mS (as written in the .md file) works ?  E.t. where does it embed features ?"
"Hi all,    I've been trying to train insightface from scratch for smaller input image size, 64x64. The sturcture is r50 and dataset is emore.    I first trained on my local workstation with batch size 128. The validation accuracy on agedb_30 is 0.96. Validation accuracy is 0.4, loss is around 6. And I tested it on my private dataset, had an accuracy of 0.996.    And then I trained it on a remote server using the same setting except batch size, this time I set it to 512 since the server has a better GPU. I also trained it using a single card. The validation accuracy on agedb_30 was 0.974, which is a little better as expected. Validation accuracy was 0.67, loss was 3. However, when I tested this model on my private dataset, the accuracy was only 0.96, 3.6% lower than the previous model.    The test codes are exactly the same. One possible reason might be the different cuda driver version I have locally and remotely (396 vs 418). And when running on remote server, I used docker for convenience. But I don't know how to eliminate this possibility except training again remotely using batch size 128.    Any idea what might caused this problem?    Thanks."

"I am trying to convert an MXNET model to TVM in order to improve the inference speed.  I am able to convert it successfully, however I do not experience the improvements in speed which are advertised on      I have followed the tutorial  , but I will go through the steps I took.    I first downloaded the Insightface model `LResNet100E-IR,ArcFace@ms1m-refine-v2` which can be found  . Note that I am using the same model from the TVM benchmark.    Next, I use the following python script to convert the model to the TVM compatible models  Note that when I run the command `llc --version` I get the following output (which is why I set the target to `skylake`)     Python conversion script        When I run the script, I get the following warning messages:     but it ultimately exports the models successfully.

On average, the inference takes 360ms, which is roughly the same time it takes to perform inference using MXNET (C++, MKLDNN). I was expecting to see a significant decrease in inference time.     I am not sure if the issue has to do with the warnings during the conversion?

"Hi, @nttstar , this project is great and I have some questions to ask you.    If the two photos in the comparison are abnormal faces, such as very blurred faces, non-faces, and extreme side faces, their feature vectors will have a similar degree of similarity such as 70% or more (I guess because they don’t already have the characteristics of normal faces, so the inferred features are not comparable to the features of normal faces, but the feature vectors between non-face images will be similar).     In the production environment, if the bottom library has unclean photos, and the front-end camera also accidentally pushes the undetected non-face photo, an error comparison will occur. In addition to ensuring the cleanliness of the database and improving the accuracy of camera face detection, what are the options for optimizing the face recognition model to avoid this problem?    Thank you! Looking forward to your favourable reply."

进入Evaluation/Megaface根据README下载并解压缩到./data中。  修改了model路径，运行run.sh。  开始生成特征并remove_noise。  然后在运行run_experience.py时候，卡在0.99800然后程序就不动了，有人遇见过吗。

"I used ArcFace to train ResNet-18IR nets with (1) cleaned MS-Celeb dataset, (2) the same R-18 net but with VGG2 dataset. Now I see that MegaFace results are completely different, MS Celeb model is about 15% better. Also VGG2 trained model demonstrate very good results for VGG2 test set, but MS-Celeb model fails for VGG2 test set. As it looks for me MS-Celeb and VGG2 sets are different in some parameters.   I didn't see that behavior for CenterLoss, MSCeleb trained model is better for Megaface (it's clear why), but the same model is also better for VGG2 test set.  Did anyone see something similar?

我在LFW上跑了一次测试，1：1和1：N的分值交差较大    1：1上限分值在98.8，集中分布在80到98.8之间  1：N（不同人）上限分值在88.2，集中分布在50到88.2    测试基数是3006人，从结果来看，80到88.2为交差严重的分值，也就是说，如果以3006为基数做1：N比对情况，为达到不误识别，需要将预值至少设为88.2，如果从88.2来算，通过率只有(3006-1079)/3006=64.105123087159015302727877578177%

你好，首先感谢您开源的代码。  我的问题比较大：  在使用softmax训练时，在vgg数据集上我的acc可以做到从0增大，ce-loss从40开始减小，我认为这非常好  当使用我自己的数据集时，ce-loss初始值在8-11左右（我认为这个loss值很小，不是很正常）当跑完大概12000个batch后，acc依然为0，ce-loss始终保持在5-8左右震荡。  我的数据集大小为57733类*210张图片，其中大多数图片为增强的图片。  我想请问我的ce-loss是否正常，或者针对我的数据集应该做参数的调整？  非常感谢您！  !   上面是我的loss图
"Hi all, I hope someone tried this. I have trained ResNet-18 with Softmax, Centerloss and finally ArcFace. VGG2 was used as training data, no alignment step has been done because we use another face detection approach. VGG2 test results are the following: 68% for SoftMax, about 89% for CenterLoss ( more than 20% boost) and surprisingly only 70% for ArcFace. I guess this caused because alignment step is missed and because of some reasons this step is extremely important for ArcFace and not so important for CenterLoss. But it's just an assumption. Does anyone have experience in training with no aligned images?  Thank you!"

"May I ask the settings of training iterations:  - In `train_softmax.py`, I think `mbatch = param.epoch*batch_iteration_per_epoch + param.nbatch`.   - For softmax loss, `lr_steps=[40000,60000,80000]` convert to epoch, means to decay approximately at `[5.3, 8.1, 10.7]`. I do not know whether I calculate correctly: `40000*512/(3.8*10**6)=5.3`. Here 5.3 rather than 5, means the model decays at middle of 5-th epoch.   - For other angular margin-based losses, since they are harder, `lr_steps=[100000,140000,160000]`. Converting to epoch, they decay at `[13.4, 18.6,21.55]`.   - However, I observe that in the log, the model decays at epoch=[6.6,10.6, 13.3] and finishes at epoch 14.9.     Could you help me check whether my understanding is correct? And may I ask whether the softmax loss can achieve better performance, given longer training time as other margin-based loss?

"I have tested the pretrained LResNet50E-IR mxnet model on my own dataset and it works very well. However, when I use the same mtcnn and alignment method, then feed the aligned image to the pretrained caffe model.

And the distance between different people's images is not much larger than the same people's images, and sometimes it's even smaller.    I'm wondering if there is any difference between those two models, maybe they need different input channel order, different normalization method?

"Hello,  In your ReadMe.md, in the section ""Pretrained Models"", you say that ""You can use $INSIGHTFACE/src/eval/verification.py to test all the pre-trained models.""    When I look inside this verification.py, it uses this code to compute the score:  diff = np.subtract(embeddings1, embeddings2)  dist = np.sum(np.square(diff),1)    This score is not adapted to SphereFace, CosineFace, ArcFace. For these loss functions, we must use embeddings1.dot_product(embeddings2).    Looking at the header of the verification.py, I see that it is written by David Sandberg - the author of facenet (  In facenet, I remember that they use TripletLoss and then the score = sum_of_square_of_difference makes sense..    In one of pre-trained model (  I see that the file name is arcface50-caffe (the term ""arcface"" rings me a bell :) ). Then I guess if I use this trained model, I have to use dot_product to compute the distance between 2 embeddings.    Am I wrong ?    Thanks !"

在windows 下 准备跑ssh 模型，遇到这个问题
我使用的是sphereface中的matlab程序代码进行的裁剪的lfw图片（112X112），也是使用他的matlab测试代码进行的测试（使用你release的caffe模型），但是效果不到99%，请问是因为我使用的matlab，而你使用的是python的原因么？
您好，今天在做mxnet C++版本实现人脸识别的时候，发现一个有趣的问题。  按我对人脸识别流程的理解，训练本质其实是分类，训练生成的模型最后一层输出维度应该是num_classes，就是类别数目；要找到任一张图片的embedding特征，应该在交叉熵或者其他形式的损失之前的一层去查看，这个层的输出一般来讲是512维的。  但是我今天用C++版本进行前向过程的时候发现，在没有做中间某一层的特征提取的时候，模型最后一层的输出是512维！这个我感到很有意思！  是您在保存模型的时候已经做了处理，把模型保存到了交叉熵前一层吗？  而且我在阅读您的源码的时候，确实发现在某一特定模型在调用get_symbol()函数时，确实是将实参emb_size传给了形参num_classes，这里我也不是特别了然。     @nttstar 盼 望您的解答，多谢！
RT。此repo提供的MTCNN对卡通图片误检率特别高，但原版MTCNN并不会这样，不知是对MTCNN做了何种处理？关键的是，检测到的框也并非卡通人物的人脸区域。但用repo给出的emore训练模型，就必须用此repo的MTCNN对齐才能得到好的结果。。

"I want to use another face detection algorithm instead of MTCNN. As MTCNN accuracy isn't very good for detecting some faces. So, I have used my own implemented Face Detection Algorithm which it's accuracy is better than MTCNN. However, I have faced a new problem. The problem is that I can't get appropriate results with integration of the new face detection method via your face embedding model. I think the problem related to the face alignment method. As your example (in `./deploy/test.py`) you have used the MTCNN face detector and then by using its landmark detection you have aligned the face image and then pass it to the face embedding model (_e.g.,_ _LResNet50E-IR_). Unfortunately, my face detector just detect faces and doesen't have any face landmark localization method. Would you please kindly help me to guide me how I can integrate this new face detection method (without landmark localization) into your face embedding models?  It is worth nothing that I can integrate it into the face embedding model (i.e., without face alignment) but the results were bad.   "

"I use insightface to retrain **mobilefacenet** , then get new params.  But when I transfer it into **NCNN** and validate the **infer** result ,it's **quite different** from the infer result by **MXNET.**  I found ""**fix_gamma**"" param in the last bn layer of json file is the key factor.  “fix_gamma” is set to true in the original json file of mobilefacenet，when I change it into false in infer stage, the infer result out by MXNET becomes same with NCNN.  After reading MXNET code ,I guess this param should be set to false when doing infer.  But in insightface code train_softmax.py, the verification func ver_test , this param seems doesnot change to false, thus the verification result is correct?

Help needed by sophomore in CQUPT ~
"Hi there,    I find that many filters in conv0_weight have near-zero weights. For example, in the r50 model I trained, 34 out of the 64 filters have abs sum of weights   99.8 on lfw and >98.0 on agedb and cfp_fp, and reaching TPR>80%@FAR<1e-8 on one of my own testing dataset.    But problem happens when I try to convert the mxnet model to my own format for serving purpose. I have a light weighted inference library which does not support bn layers, so I have to merge the bn layers into the conv layers.  Since conv0 have many weak filters, and the following bn0 and stage1_unit1_bn1 try to normalize the very weak responses, using very small gamma and moving_var,  the order of computation matters. It is ok to merge bn0 into conv0, but it is problematic when merging stage1_unit1_bn1 into stage1_unit1_conv1, significant numerical errors will be produced after merging stage1_unit1_bn1 into stage1_unit1_conv1.    My problem can be bypassed by introducing the bn layer into my inference library so that the first bn in each residual block is left as it is. But I think these nearly dead neurons are worthy of further investigation.              "

"@nttstar     Hi    First of all thanks for your support in the issues section. I had a question regarding the possibility to batch multiple images for faster inference:    **Is it possible to get the embedding of many images in one go instead of repeatedly calling the `get_feature` method?**    My inference time for just one cropped image is nearly 20ms per image but I was wondering if this time could be reduced for batches of images.    I wrote a code to initialize the Model with variable `batch_size`s (I used 10, 25 and 50) and fed `self.model.forward(db)` with a list of cropped and aligned images (between 100 or a 1000 images) but two strange things happened:    1. The inference time increased when passing `n` images to it compared to when I called `get_feature` repeatedly `n` times.    2. No matter how much I changed the `batch_size` (from 1 to 50), the inference time stayed near 30 ms per image.    I'm more familiar with Tensorflow than MXNet and I was wondering if I'm doing something wrong with these parts of the code:     "

"Have you ever done ablation analysis on the scaling parameter s?  In other words, what do we rely on to set s? the number of IDs? or the distribution of dataset?"
"I have read the implementation of angular margin in your code. It seems there are some details not mentioned in the paper.    Let t be the angle between a feature vector and the weight vector of its groundtruth class. The value of t is in [0, pi]. Let m be the margin parameter. m must be  = 0. Let s be the scaling factor.    If no margin is applied, the score of the groundtruth class input to the softmax layer is s * cos(t).  The angular margin is then implemented as follows:  if t + m   cos(pi - m), the score of the groundtruth class is changed to s * cos(t+m).  if t + m >= pi: If easy_margin is true, the score of the groundtruth class is not modified. Otherwise the score of the  groundtruth class is changed to s * (cos(t) - m*sin(pi-m)).    So for very hard instances (t + m >= pi), the code actually falls back to cosine margin with margin=m*sin(pi-m). This actually creates a discontinuity point on the target logit curve.     The paper says:      the target logit curve is not monotonic decreasing  when theta in [0, 180] ... the increasing interval of ArcFace is almost never reached during training. Therefore we do not need to deal with this explicitly.    But actually you have dealt with this explicitly in the code.      "

"When I used the align_facescrub.py to handle the original Facescrub, I found some of the cropped images are badly cropped, the faces are not at center and even no face in image at all. I checked the code and found that the problem is that some bounding boxes provided by Facescrub in facescrub_actors.txt and facescrub_actresses.txt are wrong. The align_facescrub.py uses that bounding boxes information to calculate IOU. As wrong bounding boxes have low IOU with faces detected by MTCNN, the face detection fails. I fixed wrong bounding boxes in facescrub_actors.txt and facescrub_actresses.txt , and here is the correction I made:     Not center, bad crop:    Image                           |    original bounding boxes |     corrected bounding boxes  actresses:  Erin_Cummings_17432        (278,131,427,280)                    (175,60,325,250)  Erin_Cummings_17279        (208,162,429,383)                   (150,50,340,325)  Morena_Baccarin_3599      (50,477,831,1258)                    (75,50,575,700)  Andrea_Bowen_9073          (105,89,237,221)                       (160,40,260,160)  Brianna_Brown_10442        (105,38,237,170)                       (50,30,270,300)   actors:  Mark_Wahlberg_40368      (103,87,229,213)                        (125,40,325,350)  Robert_Duvall_49660        (177,181,562,566)                       (70,35,325,410)    No face:  actresses:  Fran_Drescher_22942      (434,169,544,279)                      (365,125,445,240)  Joanna_Kerns_40134        (183,102,290,209)                      (350,125,540,400)  actors:  Shia_LaBeouf_53180        (351,118,665,432)                        (210,10,400,250)  Robert_Duvall_49687        (283,94,435,246)                       (200,30, 310,200)    By doing this, you do not have to change the code in align_facescrub.py in order to detect the missing faces, so that ensures you are using same codes to deal with megaface distraction images.    #167 mentioned failed to replicate the results in megaface, using the align_facescrub.py    #144 also mentioned the differences between images in aurthor's facescrub_images_112x112.tar, and images generated by the align_facescrub.py    This may help you get all the faces.

"Thanks for your contributions in the community of face recognition.   As discussed in the #19, I also want to use the clean list for my own alignment method. I extract the images from the original tsv file and name them by the rule ""mid/searchid.jpg"". But how do I attach label for each image? It seems that MID is not reliable for the unique person label. For example, the directory of MID m.0107_f contains different people. What's more, other clean lists constructed by other institutions also indicates that MID does not map to the person label in a one-to-one manner. "

What I found is the resulting accuracy hardly depends on alignment.   I used default MTCNN face and facial landmarks detector (MtcnnDetector.detect_face()) with default parameters (minsize=20, threshold=[0.6,0.7,0.8], factor=0.709) instead of mentioned within demo scripts (MtcnnDetector.detect_face_limited()). This way I've reached accuracy 97,5%.  Next I used pre-detected lfw_landmarks obtained from SphereFace project (  without running MTCNN detector. And this allowed me to reach accuracy 99,7%.

"According to the numbers in the paper, it seems that models trained on VGG2 have higher accuracy on CFP-FP than models trained on MS1M, while the relation is reversed for AgeDB-30.

Does this mean that there is something alike between VGG2 and CFP-FP, such that a model trained on VGG2 already knows something about CFP-FP and performs better than that trained on MS1M?

"I was training on one computer yesterday, and everything goes fine: 121 samples/sec for 1 gpu, and 242 samples/sec for 2 gpus. Today I want to use another computer, so I directly moved the hard disk on which the OS is installed to the other computer, and then the training speed stucked at 100 samples/sec no matter how many gpus used or how the MXNET_CPU_WORKER_NTHREADS is set. Then I moved the hard disk back to the first computer, and it still stucked at 100 samples/sec! So now I badly need help and advice so that I would not have to reinstall the operating system. p.s.

The gpu utilization fluctuates between 0% and 99%, and the cpu usage is no higher than 5%.    I also run image net training on the same computer, using the gluon interface of mxnet, and set the number of workers in data loader to 8. Then I can see 9 (1 master + 8 workers) python processes running from the system monitor, and the gpu utilization is high all the time.    So I guess somehow the insightface training failed to open MXNET_CPU_WORKER_NTHREADS workers for processing the data, which limits the overall throughput. Then the question is how I can fix this problem except reinstalling the operating system? I have tried reinstalling mxnet several times, but it does not work.      "

"Hi@nttstar, is there any code sample on how to extract images in train.rec? thank you "
"In your paper, your said:    > We manually clean the FaceScrub dataset and finally find 605 noisy face images. During testing, we change the noisy face to another right face, which can increase the identification accuracy by about 1%.     So I'd like to know if your  83.27% identity result on megaface is tested using the cleaned facescrub list  or official list. Because in my test on megaface using official list, I got only 79.65% identity accuracy. Thank you! @nttstar "

"Initially, I meet the issue of out of memory issue on TITAN X 12GB, so I change per GPU batch size from 128 to 64, so the batch_size is 64*4=256. However, the training speed is only **26 examples/sec**. The version of MXNet is 1.2.0    So, I adopt the suggestions (  from @gaohuazuo (  for out of memory issue. In his comments, he tested on 1080Ti x4, mxnet-cu80, r100, per GPU batch size 128. Memory 8.3G, **speed 308 examples/sec**.    But I followed the operations he suggested, the training speed is still very low on my server, it is only **28 examples/sec**. I test on P100x4 with each 16 GB, mxnet-cu80, r100, loss_type=4, per GPU batch size 128, Memory 8.3G (I also try the setting with per GPU batch size 192, Memory 10.3G, also very low only **32 examples/sec**).     Moreover, If I do not use memonger, P100x4 with each 16 GB, mxnet-cu80, r100, loss_type=4, per GPU batch size 128, the training speed is almost the same as **30 examples/sec**.     Do you know how to fix the issue of speed ?    "
@nttstar   1. I am new to Face Recognition and I have a limited hardware resources.  Could you approximately tell us the minimum GPU mem required to train `LResNet100-E-IR` on setting `MS1M@ArcFace`?   For batch_size of 1 and 128 would be perfect.  I currently have 2 GTX 1080s    2. Could you tell us the approximate performance if I were to train `MS1M@Triplet` because in case my resources do not suffice  for Softmax/ArcFace Traing I will go with `MS1M@Triplet`    Thank you very much!

当我使用test.py文件的的时候，我发现 mtcnn 只使用了detect_face_limited  函数，而没有用detect_face函数，导致lfw有些图片检测不到人脸，之后我把threshold[2]=0.2改为0（按照sphereface论文测试lfw的方法）将lfw原图输入程序进来测试，准确率只有80%。  请问问题是出在mtcnn的方法选择上么？但是readme写的就是只用mtcnn的R+O部分网络就ok了呀？求解

I have one machine which is running mxnetcu75 on old ubuntu. I found model.get_feature generate different feature value for the same face with the other machine running mxnetcu80. How can I get same result for mxnetcu75? Thanks.
"Dear @nttstar ,     Would like to teach us how to figure gradients respect to w and feature embeding. This particular important to non-autograd framework like caffe. Thanks"
"Thanks for your cleaning list.    In MS1M dataset, each line has the following format:  MID,ImageSearchRank,ImageURL,PageURL,FaceID,FaceRectangle,FaceData  What is the naming conversion of your list?  For example:  m.0933t2\0.jpg  the directory name corresponds to MID, what about the file name? Which item does the file name correspond to?  Thanks a lot.  !       "

"Hi,  In your paper you report results on LFW when trained on VGGface2 in tables 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8, but I think there are quite a lot of overlapping identities between LFW and VGGface2 as both are based on celebrities. Have you checked for overlapping identities? Have you removed them when training? If not, it does not seem quite fair to report those numbers, or maybe it should be mentioned in the paper?    Also, when you say you are training with VGGface2, are you using the train and test set of VGGface2 (i.e. 8,631 +  500  identities) or just the train set of VGGface2 (8,631)?"

您好，首先感谢您的工作！  初学者想请问一下1：N具体是体现在什么地方呢？  看了verification.py的源码，好像做的还是1:1的对比啊。

Do you pre-train the modified Res50/... backbones weights on imagenet and then fine-tune the entire model + customized loss on face dataset?

为什么我将batch size改小了，然后CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES设为０去训练无法达到论文中的效果，  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python -u train_softmax.py --network r50 --loss-type 2 --margin-m 0.35 --data-dir ../datasets/faces_ms1m_112x112 --prefix ../model-r50-amsoftmax  我训练epoch为12时，lfw 准确率只有９７％　后面基本不会变了  谢谢
Thanks in advance.
"Hi, thanks for the greate job. It's very powerful, and much more accurate than other repo I had used before such as dlib.  So I heard about that you may going to provide a 3D-alignment library later in #29 , I know there is a project that provide 3D-alignment, it's   and it's using pytorch.

"Hi,  I've been trying to use the deploy/test.py script on two easy examples from LFW, but encountered several problems.     First, the predefined threshold does not pass any of the images. Now, even when reducing the threshold the cosine similarity is really low (~0.1).    Looking at the images fed into the network   it seems like there is a problem with the MTCNN alignment, the images are badly cropped, and look different from the images inside the LFW verification bin.      Any ideas? "

Every time I train a model with insightface, it says ""`UserWarning: Optimizer created manually outside Module but rescale_grad is not normalized to 1.0/batch_size/num_workers (0.25 vs. 0.001953125)`"", which cause my attention.    In mxnet, SGD(standard updates) are applied by:          I think rescale_grad = 1.0/batch_size/num_workers is more natural,  because the gradient is averaged by batch_size and is closer to the true full-batch gradient. I don't understand why use 1.0 / args.ctx_num instead .    Any help will be appreciated, thanks in advance."

I see there are two methods, `detect_face()` and `detect_face_limited()`. The `detect_face()` signature is         But the actual shape checking treats an image as a `[height, width, channel]` array:         Therefore the detection fails at some point.    I also tried `detect_face_limited()`, and saw the `[1]` and `[2]` of threshold getting used to do the filtering and decreased those values to get more results. But still, e.g. this picture has four faces, and I'm getting as many as only one.         How can I get all those faces?"

"Some questions need you guys to help answer, thanks in advance!    - `add fixed margin 44`.       - have you guys tried other margin values and see if any improvements?  - `similarity transformation`,       - have you guys tried other transformations, I noticed that in `face_preprocess.py` there are some commented code which looks like projective transform.     - It looks like the similarity transformed image will gain black corner running `test.py`, I use the mtcnn crop the testing images, without resizing and fixed 44 margin. I am not sure if this is by design or I am wrong with the cropping steps -:)    !   - `mtcnn 5 landmarks`      - It looks like mtcnn 5 landmarks are not accurate regarding side face, if use more accurate lardmarks, shall it improve the performance?

"per the code in `deploy/test.py`:        it seems that the input should be cropped as square with width as 112, however the mtcnn output may be rectangle, I thought the detailed steps to run `test.py` are as below:    1. use mtcnn to crop the face images with margin 44  2. resize cropped face to 112x112  3. run `test.py` and the script will do face alignment with mtcnn    I am curious if my understanding is wrong, I thought the alignment before resizing should be more reliable?"

"Hi, I was wandering what are is the difference between ""np.sum(detected_pts)"" (true positives count) and ""np.sum(detected_gt)"" which is used to estimate false negatives count?. My understanding is that gt are the real points and pts are the detected ones ( within the radius), but what would be the difference if the r is big enough and why are not the same?.   For instance, in a mall set, you have 5 persons and the program correctly identifies 3 of them. True positives will be 3, false positives 2 and false negatives will also be 2 and therefore that sums(detected) will be equal. I also get that both will be higher with a bigger radius  but the gt one will be bigger that the pts one (Sometimes). Question is because in your paper you wrote as False Negative definition : ""A false negative is counted if a true location does have any estimated location at a distance at most r"" which for me is the same as True Positive definition wich is the same just from the point of the estimated location. And if it is a misspelling why False negative is not the same as False positive?  Thankyou for your attention"

"Would you happen to have any intuition on this?  I'm using a U-net style network (with skipped connections). Output -> 3 channels. The centre of mass, in my case, the pupil centre, is regressed from channel 1.    I use torch.sigmoid on channel 1 before giving it as input to weighted H loss and a sufficiently small learning rate (5e-5) with ADAM.    I observe that the loss reduces 0.03 -> 0.009 and the output starting to look as expected from channel 1, i.e, we start seeing the expected blob. Post convergence to a minima (which happens within 1 epoch), the loss goes its maximum (0.1 in my case) and stays there. I checked the gradient norms and found that there is a lot of fluctuation in the norm values. Furthermore, the loss is jumpy on every iteration.    Would you have an intuition about this?"
"Hello,   Thanks for this nice paper and the code.   Of my understanding, in you code (WeightedHausdorffDistance class), the ground truth gt is a list of point corresponding to different objects. Is it possible to have gt a list of point from the same object ?    I am wondering of using your loss for a segmentation task in medical imaging to replace (or in parallel of) Dice Loss. So we have the ground truth segmentation of one object.     Best Regards,   Théo"
"Could you comment on the following? I believe it would help me and potentially future readers:    1. Have you used this loss in a multitask sense? For example, combining segmentation and heat-maps from your loss?  2. What happens if you try spatial softmax for the heat-map instead of sigmoid?  3. In a multi-class problem where number of GT points are known and fixed, could you potentially make N heat-maps for N points, softmax across channels and expect your solution to work?"
"Hi,    Great work. Might be including in future papers of mine. Found one issue:       Might help if you explicitly mentioned that in the case for 1 GT point, be sure to provide it as list of a [1, 2] tensors. This shape is consistent with your code and would lead to failure if people provided GT points as [2, ] or [2, 1].    Further, I suggest removed ""device"" dependency during function definition and instead consider something like this `self.all_img_locations = self.all_img_locations.to(prob_map.device)`    Would help future users who train on cluster."
How can we calculate number of points?
"Hi,  The trained network detects objects only in those images which have the same dimensions as of the training images. Can it be modified to detect objects in test images with different dimensions? "

"Hello, I am having the same issue as #9 and #11 , which were both closed due to inactivity. Is the only suggested solution to use this on a Unix machine?

"I know there's been many issues related with validation time.  But to me, it's not clear.    I am training mall dataset and set --taus as default= -2 since it's faster than other ways.  It still took about 4.5s per image for validation.  I saw one posting that you said 'Only the neural network can use GPU. The thresholding and EM can only use CPU'.  does that mean validation only has to be worked with CPU? Can I know  the reason?     Thank you"
"Hello,    I tried to run your codes according README.md .  But I can't solve about mall_dataset problem.    Your 'readme' suggests that I should have well-formatted gt.csv file.    and repos contains some '.txt to .csv' python code.    But mall dataset link's zip file has only .mat ground truth file.    Of course, It'll be fine if i spend more time adjusting .mat file...!,  but I wondered there is another way to solve this problem or something I missed! Thank you :)"

"Hello!    Several problems appear when I use your codes.    First of all, my data are 4000x6000 drone images, previously cut into 400x400, of animals.  I work with Windows 10 on Anaconda prompt, with a 4GB GPU.    I run a training with this command:  `python -m object-locator.train --train-dir mytraindir --batch-size 1 --visdom-env training --visdom-server localhost --visdom-port 8097 --epochs 2 --lr 1e-3 --val-dir myvaldir --save otherdir\saved_model.ckpt --nThreads 1 --imgsize 400x400`    Training is going well. However, an error occurs during the validation, at each loaded image:  `C:\Users\delplaal\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\object-locator\lib\site-packages\object-locator\utils.py:86: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide    array_scaled = ((array - minn)/(maxx - minn)*255)`    It seems that the denominator is zero, but I do not know where that comes from.    Finally, at the end of this pseudo-validation, this error appears:  `E: Don't overwrite a checkpoint without resuming from it. Are you sure you want to do that? (if you do, remove it manually).`    And I get a broken pipe. So I can't do more than one epoch.     I also tried without validation and I get this error:  `File ""C:\Users\delplaal\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\object-locator\lib\runpy.py"", line 193, in _run_module_as_main      ""__main__"", mod_spec)    File ""C:\Users\delplaal\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\object-locator\lib\runpy.py"", line 85, in _run_code      exec(code, run_globals)    File ""C:\Users\delplaal\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\object-locator\lib\site-packages\object-locator\train.py"", line 273, in        if args.save and (epoch + 1) % args.val_freq == 0:  ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero`    I'm stuck. What can I do to fix this?    Here is a sample of my dataset:      Thank you in advance for your answers!    Alexandre    "
"As specified in the paper, you did a train/val/test split on the mall dataset (2000 frames) of 80/10/10 which would give 200 testing frames. How long should it take to locate all the objects for those 200 images? After using a script to turn the .mat file into train/val/test datasets with the proper ground truth files and using the command   `python -m object-locator.locate --dataset mall_dataset/mall_test/ --out mall_out/ --model mall.ckpt --evaluate`  it takes **~1.5 hours** to run on the entire testing set which is much longer than the training/validation iterations. I'm just running it locally on an i5-6600k and a 1070. Training was taking about 1.5 minutes per epoch and validation was around 5 minutes which makes me wonder what I could be doing wrong for testing. Perhaps this is expected, but I just wanted to check.    Thanks in advance!"
"The code ran for 1800 epochs. The loss didn't get lower anymore. The object locations in training look too wide. I used the following command with the parameters. Could you guide me to improve the accuracy of the object locations?    python -m object-locator.train --train-dir ""data/mall_small_dataset"" --batch-size 10 --lr 1e-6 --val-dir  ""data/mall_small_validate"" --optim adam --val-freq 10  --save ""data/mall_small_dataset-model.ckpt"" --visdom-env mall_500_v2_dataset_training  --visdom-server   --visdom-port 8097 --imgsize 256x320 --resume ""data/mall_small_dataset-model.ckpt""    !     Thank you"
"Hi, very excited reading your paper and code.  The loss function containing weighted Hausdorff distance was designed for object detection task in this paper, can weighted Hausdorff distance be directly introduced into semantic segmentation task?    Thank you very much!"
"     !     I have created a smaller dataset to see the training of the network. For faster training, the mall images were cropped to 1/2 in width and height and only 500 images were fed into the training (see the attached dataset, a ground-truth image, and a Visdom screenshot at 1200 epochs). The following command was used for training:    ---mall_small_dataset command for training  python -m object-locator.train --train-dir ""data/mall_small_dataset"" --batch-size 16 --lr 1e-4 --val-dir  ""data/mall_small_dataset"" --optim adam --val-freq 10  --save ""data/mall_small_dataset-model.ckpt"" --visdom-env mall_small_dataset_training  --visdom-server   --visdom-port 8097    The code performed 1200 epochs overnight, but it still hasn't converged to object locations yet. Could you give me guidance to resolve the problem?      !       Thank you"

"Hi, Thanks for providing the code. It is mentioned in the code that a pre-trained model comes with this package. The pre-trained model ""unet_256x256_sorghum.ckpt"" is not available in checkpoints folder. I was trying to test the code initially on the provided test set. It is giving an error on this file while testing. Should I train it again with any data set first then?"
"thank you very much for sharing the codes.    I have some questions about the Averaged Hausdorff Loss. currently i am trying to solve a boundary detection problem based on medical image dataset. I tried to use your codes for AveragedHausdorffLoss, however inputs of your function are two point sets while my inputs are 2-class softmax probability map and ground truth labels.  The critical issue here is that  I have to calculate set1 from the probability map using torch.max() while the torch.max() function is not differentiable and thus not able to be pack-propagated.     My question is do u know some methods to avoid the 'not being able to be back-propagated' problem or other implementations which directly use the prob map to calculate loss.    Best regards!"

what is wrong with it？  best wishes

"Functions CRF_Map and ICRF_Map are very slow in python (each function takes about 8 seconds when processing a 512x512 image)  and are bottlenecks in efficiency.

"Hi I tried to reproduce the whole training procedure according to your paper  I set the level map as \sigma_c + \sigma_s*L and converted it to 0~1, and simply concat  the map with rgb image as the input of blind denoise net    The training process is ok and I can get a good result on sidd or etc, when the noise is not very high.   However the denoised image is a little blurred, did you find this in your origin work?  Also when the noise getting higher the result gets worse, so I tried to give the noise level map a coefficient(x2) as mention in section 4.4 of the paper, but I found it just changed nothing. Even x2 gives barely any changes, which is more strange. I think if the noisy level map matters, giving a zero map should leads to a very bad denoise result right (as denoise ≈ input)?    In fact I've read the paper many times but I did't found how you take the noise map as input, am I right about concating it with the rgb image, or I just missed something? Also did you do any experiments about is? Like training a net without using the noise level map as a supervision (which means let LAMBasy = 0 and LAMBtv = 0), and compare the PSNR changes?"

您好：  目前我在寻找一种处理真实噪声的网络模型。您预训练的模型十分适用于我的数据集（医疗方向），去噪效果比较优异，但也有low-level上的细节损失，所以我想根据您分享的matlab训练代码用于我的数据集中。  拜读过您的论文以后我有几个问题想了解：  1)论文里您提到噪声估计网络中需要输入noisy observation y来产生noise level map σ_hat(y)，我是否可以理解为：noisy observation y = 带有真实噪声的原图，noisy level map σ_hat(y)是噪声的分布？  2)基于问题1)，CNN_D把CNN_E的输出作为输入，最终输出为去噪图像，那么整个CNN_D+CNN_E是不需要训练集的清晰图像？

"Hi Guo Shi,     I am trying to train the estimator network alone in the tensorflow and have few questions about training settings that I could not get answers from the paper of the GitHub page; would you please answer them?    1. In paper the patch size is mentioned to be 128x128 -- are these patches cropped from images at random? or they are cropped on a grid basis with a stride from each training image?   2. How many number of batches are there in one epoch?  3. Are the 1600 images from each Waterloo and FiveK data sets are chosen at random befogging the training or they different in each epoch?  4. From paper it takes around 3 days to train full network, do you have any estimate for the estimator network -- since the estimator seems to be a fraction of the full CBDNet.     Hoping to get a prompt response.  Thank you!         "
"Hi Guo Shi,    Can you please explain the UNet being used in CBDNet a little bit more. Few things are unclear from the description in the paper.     Example:-  1. The original UNet paper uses max-pooling to reduce the size of the image, however it looks like in CBDNet it is done through convolution strides.  2. Also it is unclear at what level the features are concatenated -- shouldn't that be shown by increasing the width of green and yellow rectangles in figure2 of the paper e.g. that is how it was shown in Fig1 of original UNet paper cited in CBDNet.  3. Are the conv layers in UNet being padded -- otherwise the resolution would be different?     Since the model is in MatConvNet and not everyone has access to Matlab.     Thank you for your time!  Touqeer"
"Hi,  Great work and very good effort towards actual denoising instead of celebrating AWGN denoising as many others do :)   I was curious as to why you did not continue using the strategy used in FFDNet where the image is downscaled to four quarter size images and concatenated with the noise map.     Why not just replace the noise map (based on AWGN sigma) with the noise map generated by Noise Estimator Network? I was wanting to know if you gave FFDNet architecture a try or otherwise what was the reason to deviate from that towards UNet?    Thank you!  "
I found using 1 single gpu is very time consuming. But I have some trouble using multi-gpus with matconvnet. I wonder if you can show me how to modify the code to adapt multi-gpus settings?
What is the ground truth for noise level map when JPEG compression is considered?  Is it still \sigma_c + L\sigma_s ?  Thank you
"I suppose `CRF_Map` and `ICRF_Map` is somehow reversed (“写反了”） either revered in comments or in callee function `AddNoiseMosai`.    - Detail:  In `CRF_Map` comment, input image (RGB?) and returns L, while in `ICRF_Map` comment, input L and returns image.  But in `AddNoiseMosai`, I believe it inputs image and returns noised image. But it first calls `ICRF_Map` and then calls `CRF_Map` at last.    So I suppose your comment is wrong."
"Hi, it's an amazing work!  I wonder in your noise model (EQ 3), did you try to train the model with and without CRF? If we train CBDNet without the knowledge of CRF, how much gap will appear in real photo denoising?  I don't find any comparison among EQ 1, 2 and 3."
"In the paper you use various datasets (BSD500, Waterloo etc.) that have various sized images. For training 128x128 sized patches are used. Could you give information about the number of patches extracted (Like in DnCNN paper)?  So basically I want to know the dimensions of the training dataset ?x128x128x3. Also did you use any data augmentation methods?"
Hello. What is the receptive field of the denoising network (CNN_d)? My calculations yield 83. I used the info given in the network illustration and the fact that all filters are 3x3 (strided and transpose conv). Is this correct? I assumed that the receptive field would be as large as the training input (128x128)
"Hello, I noticed you used L2 norm instead of F norm in your paper.   !   !   In the loss function, it seems the variable x and y are matrices because I haven't seen any sum operation.  Notably, with regard to vectors, L2 norm is equal to F norm. But for matrix, L2 norm is totally different from F norm.   I want to confirm whether you used L2 norm of the matrix because papers often use F norm rather than L2 norm in image denoising.   Can you help me? Thanks a lot!"
"Hi,    Thanks a lot for sharing your test code!     I am trying to re-train using the same approach that you mentioned in the paper. I am not able to understand how the ground truth for the noise level map was generated for synthetic data (from the paper/code).    Can you please explain how you create the ground truth for the noise level map? For e.g., each pixel in the noise level map contains the std. dev. information in RGB domain or something else?     If you can share the code that would be great as well.     Thanks,  Tejas"
Hello;  Could you explain to me what is the ground truth for your noise estimation network.  Thank you very much.

"Thank you very much for your excellent work. When I ran the code you provided, I encountered some problems, several of which were not solved. I'd like to consult you.  1: What are the specific meanings of ""positive"" and ""negative"" in train.py?  2: In the paper, D_Loss = Ls + Lc1, G_Loss = Lc2 - Ls; but in the program, what I see is  Los_g = λL1 + (1-λ) L2, loss_d =λL1 + (1-λ) L2. Is the definition of loss function in the paper consistent with that in the program?  3: When I validate your program with other data sets, at the step of saving real images, the last four pictures are always black,such as   ! . I can't find the reason. I hope you can give me some suggestions.  Thank you again for your help!"

"Congrats on great paper. I wanted to run your model on some smaller dataset like CIFAR10 or MNIST but when I run it on CIFAR with the defaults you provided for Imagenet (I also tried it with resnet32) I end up with a model that has acc_r=1, acc_f=0 (with singular cases on first decoder step when it varies by something like ~0.2) throughout the whole 200 epochs and both classification accuracies getting to about 0.6 acc. Could you please recommend some parameters that might work better?"
"First of all, thank you very much for your excellent work. I am a graduate student studying in mainland China. For some reasons, I can't download the Imagenet datasets. Then I want to test the code you provide with my own datasets. So can you give me some details about the data you use, such as the Imagenet-143 datasets you use, how many images are included in the data set, and how many images are used for training and testing?  Thank you very much for your help."
Thanks.

您好，请问您的论文里测试的M27的数据集使用的是原始分辨率的图像还是3倍下采样后的图像呢？看到您的论文里只有说新出的Middlebury 2014使用的是四分一分辨率的图像（这个可能是您的那篇TCSVT）。  还想请教您一个问题，就是我在利用左右视差真值计算被遮挡区域时，利用一致性计算（数据集给的SDK程序），但是通常得到的被遮挡图的左侧原本应该是被遮挡区域，而我计算得到的有的不是被遮挡，这个问题请问您当时是如何解决的？也就是左图的被遮挡区域应该包括左图像的最左侧几列的区域，而利用一致性计算时有时候那部分并不是遮挡区域。（我思考可能是因为那部分都是和相机平行的平面，视差与未被遮挡的部分相同，导致阈值选择为1时无法筛掉）主要针对Middlebury 2005及2006没有给出遮挡区域的图，故而想问问您！谢谢

Also the gradient computation in   doesn't square the `probs` value that doesn't correspond to the forward pass code.

"Hi,     From page 5:  To customize GANs for this task, one could condition on the given context information; i.e., the mask Mˆ ⊙ x. However, conditional GANs don’t train easily for context prediction task as the adversarial dis- criminator D easily exploits the perceptual discontinuity in generated regions and the original context to easily classify predicted versus real samples.    Does this means that we only rely on the ""L1 reconstruction loss"" to ensure the model to take the (outside) condition part into consideration?   Since the discriminator only sees the inpainted region, it has no additional information to work on.    Looking forward to your reply! Thanks  "
"Hi,     First of all, great and interesting work. Congratulations! I have recently started my Ph.D. and your paper was one of the few interesting and helpful baselines for me to grab some knowledge on the inpainting topic.    I tried Context Encoder (CE) on my lab's locally obtained dataset (~0.5 million images) and it outperformed many other inpainting methods that we experimented with.    But recently, I have been trying to use CE for a rather larger dataset (over 4 million images). While training, after the second or third epoch, loss of discriminator starts approaching to 0 which apparently means the generator network is not learning anymore    Can I get your expert opinion on what may be the causes? and, what parameters would be suitable to train the network for such a large dataset?

"@pathak22   I understood the method to train with the existing dataset for `centre region inpainting model` with the below command as mentioned in README.md    DATA_ROOT=dataset/train display_id=11 name=inpaintCenter overlapPred=4 wtl2=0.999 nBottleneck=4000 niter=500 loadSize=350 fineSize=128 gpu=1 th train.lua      This will give me the trained model ""inpaintCenter_500_net_G.t7""  However I have two queries:  1) Suppose I want to re-train the already trained model ""inpaintCenter_500_net_G.t7"" with new dataset how do I achieve that?    By referring the below link,       I understood that I need to load the weights from the old model to the new one.   But how do we load the weights in this context-encoder code?  Kindly let me know the approach.      2) Suppose I have trained a model ""inpaintCenter_500_net_G.t7"" with centre patch location, and I want to retrain the same model with different patch location, how do i achieve this?  Since I am a beginner to machine learning, kindly suggest.    "

"Hello @pathak22 ✋    First of all, thanks for sharing your code and research 👍 . I got the demo and training working on macOSX 10.11.5💃. However, I got stuck when trying to modify the algorithm.    I'm trying to change the code so I can specify the location of the region mask myself instead of choosing either random or center (in the testing phase).   **Can you give me pointers on how to go about doing this?**   (I was thinking to manually put white patches on the validation images and disable the automatic masking but couldn't figure it out)    Another question is, **would the algorithm work with bigger images say 1024x1024 ?**    P.S: I'm a newbie in NN so apologies if I'm asking stupid questions.  Cheers."

"Hi feichtenhofer, Thanks for providing RGB data and flow data of UCF101 dataset, It can really reduce my work on these issue and really speed up my experiments:+1:. I wonder if you can provide RGB and flow data of HMDB51 dataset? Sorry for this unreasonable request.  "
"Hello, I am very interested in your work and I am doing some reproduction work based on your work. Now I have two questions which make me a little confused. May I ask about them?  1.How do you get your final prediction? For example, if I fuse from 'temporal' to 'spatial', should I only use the prediction  of spatial net or both of the two nets? And when you got your best result in your paper, the 'nFramesPerVid' you used is also only 1?  2.Which of these two performs better in your experiment? Fuse from 'temporal' to 'spatial' or fuse from 'spatial' to 'temporal'?  I am sorry for taking your time and thank you a lot for reading my questions. I'd appreciate it a lot if you could kindly answer my questions.   "

"I currently use DeepFool as an estimate for the distance to the decision boundary of a classifier, as suggested in the paper:      I used the implementation from torchattacks because I found the implementation from the LTS4/DeepFool repo hard to understand and work without throwing errors. In the implementation from torchattacks I found an implementation error, that returned the original images as perturbation when the classifier already misclassified the image.      This might also be the case in this repo, but I havent checked, just wanted to let you know."

But this should not affect the final result."
"Use test_deepfool.py to test on two test pictures. When the generated disturbed picture enters the network again for forward calculation, the category has not changed.  The images directly generated by deepfool have relatively large changes. After performing some normalization on the disturbed images generated by deepfool in the code, it is obviously closer to the original image, but the category of the generated image has not changed.  for example:  For the picture test_im1.jpg: the original category is macaw, and the deepfool shows that the disturbed picture category is flamingo (the picture directly output by the network has changed dramatically).  But after a series of other operations, it is very similar to the original image, but at the same time, the category is still macaw."

"Hi, I've been trying to run this code on my custom dataset but couldn't understand the directory structure. Can someone help"
"I spent many hours trying to get this to work under Windows. I managed to get it to work now, so this is probably useful to others.    ## Setup  The first obstacle is the `readline` Python package, which seems to be default on Unix systems, but not on Windows. For this, simply install the `pyreadline`  package, which is a Windows port of readline.    ## Understanding the command-line  Example command: `python main.py --save_dir REDS_L1 --demo_input_dir d:/datasets/motion47set/noise_only --demo_output_dir ../results/motion47set`.   Explanation: specifying `--demo_input_dir` (or `--demo true`) will run an evaluation, using a pretrained model as specified in `--save_dir`. Every image of my motion47set will be evaluated. The results will be saved alongside the folders `src` and `experiments` at the project root, in a folder `results/motion47set`.  Note that even getting this far is not very intuitive, as others have already pointed out. Usually there is a separate python script for just evaluation/testing/inference. Next, the term demo is a bit unusual, at first I was expecting some interactive demonstration of some form. The `save_dir` I had at first used as what `demo_output_dir` does.  Another word of caution, if the output path is given without any `.`, it somehow ends up saving the results at `d:/results/motion47set`, which again took me a while to figure out, i.e. on the root of the same drive that the project is located at. I suggest printing out the absolute output dir with `os.path.abspath` to the user at some point, for clarity.    ## Bug  Running the above command will produce the following output:     Also note that ctrl+c takes a really long time to terminate for me, and even slows down my entire machine for several seconds.    This is difficult to debug, because there is no fatal exception, and everything seems to run normally, ignoring the errors, which might also just be warnings, for all we know. I did not realize for a while that MultiSaver is a file of this project, which is why there is not much help online in regards to this error/warning. Second, the only that that gives a little stronger hint that this is an error, and not a warning, is the `EOFError`, which I still don't know why or where it even happens. A large part of debugging time was me assuming these were just warnings, and trying to fix the command-line arguments instead, since that is easy to get wrong.    What is actually happening is that the MultiSaver code runs clean on the main thread, but then each spawned thread/process will fail, without the main thread being aware. As a result, the program runs through, attempts to save the output images, which all do nothing since the threads/processes already died. I'm not sure how to to achieve this, but it would be nice if the program stops running when it is unable to save output images (at least in demo mode, where that's about the only purpose).    The keywords to locate the actual issue here are `pickle` and `multiprocessing`. Going into `utils.py` and looking at the class `MultiSaver` shows us a method `begin_background`, with a method-local variable `t` (another method). Defining that method works, however (under Windows) that variable has to be pickled/serialized to hand it over to the `mp.Process`, which will run it in a different thread/process. This fails because pickle does not support local objects.  I tried various ways to change the scope of `t`:  - put `global t` before the definition of `t` (no change)  - move `t` to the outermost scope of the file utils.py, i.e. same level as MutliSaver (can pickle the method, but later fails at a different point)  - the solution that works is putting `t` on the same scope as MultiSaver, and annotating it with `@staticmethod`. The annotation avoids the first method parameter to be used as `self`.    So my modification looks like this       After this change, everything works as expected. I haven't tested it, but I suspect this will still work under Unix as well.  I'm not sure if this will work if multiple instances of `MultiSaver` are created, and maybe this would give the same result as putting `t` to the outermost scope, i.e. fail again."

"Dear author,  Thank you at first for your great work!    I am trying to use your implementation of `DistributedEvalSampler` for an evaluation purpose, jointly with DDP.  (with `shuffle=Flase` and no calling of `set_epoch()`; after calling `DistributedEvalSampler` for yielding test samples on evaluating a model, my program should be finished)    At the end of the script, my program hangs with charging 100% of GPU utilization in all 2 of 3 GPUs.  (the last device is soley terminated with no errors)  When replaced with `DistributedSampler`, this is not occurred.

"Hi,    Amazing contribution I must say, thanks for that.

Now **what am I exactly looking** for is the accurate command that just picks up the trained model and uses it to reproduce results on the testing data(right, those 1111 number of images out of 3214 total) , I don't want to train the whole model for that again and neither do I wanna use the demo functionality provided by you, I wanted to run evaluation of model on testing data standalone. However I was little confused at few places while reading your code base that what do I need to change or omit since there was no clear example command for this in the readme.    Can you please guide me through ? I am just looking for the command and/or any change I need to do in the code to run evaluation on testing data. "

"Dear Dr. Nah:    Thank you for answering my last question! I have one final question. PSNR boosts from 29.23dB (29.08 dB for 3 scales, according to the  ) to 30.40dB for the single precision model.   After studying this repo and your original repo ( ) for several days, I become curious about the key factors that boost performance.  I have the following conjectures:    (1) RGB range  , GAN loss may not help training. Besides, removal of the discriminator may help training.    (3) Learning rate schedule. Both repos train 1000 epochs using the Adam optimizer. However, the original repo sets the learning rate to its 1/10 on the 150th epoch (code/main.lua), while this code uses 5 warmup epochs and halves the learning rate (default gamma=0.5) on the milestones (the 500th, 750th, 900th epoch). The initial learning rate is 1e-4 (src/option.py, line 92) in this repo and 5e-5 in the original repo (code/opts.lua, line 53).    (4) Augmentation. The augmentation methods in this repo are slightly different from the original ones. First, this repo changes saturation with possibility 1 while the original repo changes saturation with 1/10 possibility (code/donkey.lua, line 59). Second, this repo only rotates 90 degrees while the original repo may rotate 90, 180 or 270 degrees counterclockwise.  Third, this repo uses ""flip_v"" and ""flip_h"" which flip vertically and horizontally respectively, while the original repo only uses ""flip_h"". Both repos use AWGN with sigma=2.     (5) Change from Torch to PyTorch. This seems weird. Maybe the initialization method has changed (not sure)?    CNN is a ""black box"". Therefore, I believe nobody can answer this question except you.  I am a layman to deblurring. Would you please solve my puzzle? Thanks!"
"My god, the code is a masterpiece!    I have one simple question: what is the initialization method of the convolutional weights, e.g., Xavier initialization or He initialization? Or the code just uses the default initialization method of PyTorch? I cannot find any initialization method in the code, therefore, I think that the code uses the default initialization method of PyTorch. Am I right?    I appreciate your help."

"Hi Seungjun,     I am trying to run your PyTorch code in the demo code. I have downloaded your trained models(GOPRO_L1 and GOPRO_L1_amp) and unzip into the corresponding directory and run the main.py in the demo mode successfully. However, I found some wrongs while checking the outputs of your model after applying on the test dataset of the GOPRO_Large. The output picture looked like:  !     Could you please give me some tips?    Thanks."
"The readme provides this code to generate predictions from a folder containing blurred images:       But in doing that, how do I specify which folder from the `experiments` directory is to be used to load the pretrained model that will be used to generate predictions?

Is there a viewer available for displaying pose estimates in the ransac_test file?

之前一直在研究局部描述子特征匹配，发现与人脸识别有很多相似之处，所以想借鉴一下。对于Siamese和Triplet这种度量方式很好理解，但是对于改进softmax这类方法，存在一处疑惑。sphereFace划分的类别数就是数据集中人脸的总数吗？

"hi all,  in sphereface/test/code/evaluation.m we do feature subtract mean value and then divide the L2_norm value for each feature.        % get normalized feature      mu        = mean([featureLs(:, valFold), featureRs(:, valFold)], 2);      featureLs = bsxfun(@minus, featureLs, mu);      featureRs = bsxfun(@minus, featureRs, mu);      featureLs = bsxfun(@rdivide, featureLs, sqrt(sum(featureLs.^2)));      featureRs = bsxfun(@rdivide, featureRs, sqrt(sum(featureRs.^2)));    I understood divide L2_norm value to embed feature to a standard hypersphere, but why we do feature subtract mean value first?    in my opinion, feature subtract mean value will impact the cosine similarity.  for example, vector [1, 1, 4] subtract mean value equal to [-1, -1, 2], this vector goes to an other quadrant, so it obviously impact the angle between two vectors    @wy1iu , thank you and your team for your great jobs"

"This issue is not meant to degrade your work. I may have done something wrong in my test and I need some help in verifying if my test procedure is right. I have verified my code many times and I couldn't find any error.    The dataset is:   I used your face_detect_demo.m and face_align_demo.m to detect and align faces in vggface2_train (8631 people) and vggface2_test (500 people).     Following megaface procedure with slight modification, I make vggface2_train the test set and vggface2_test the distractor.     For each identity in test set, I compute the max intraclass distance of one photo (reference) with the rest of the photos. Then, I compute the min interclass distance of this reference with the rest of the photos in both the test set and the distractor, excluding photos of the identity being tested.    A good face recognition algorithm should have min interclass distance > max intraclass distance. Each image that has this property is considered correct.    Let the number of correct photo be C. Then, if there are N total photos in the dataset, the accuracy will be C/N.    Although nobody has done such test for face recognition, I believe this is the most rigorous, stringent and robust testing method.    The code for my test is here:    I save each features into a text file and read them in the code. You may do it your way if you want to test it. Hopefully, you can check that there is no logic error in my code.    **The result I get for sphereface is a mind blowing 0%, which means there are always cases where the model misrecognize for each identity. Do you think this result is expected given my test setting? What am I doing wrong here. caffeface also give same result. If there is nothing wrong with my test, it is amazing that face recognition fails even with just 9131 people.**    "
"I retrained the SpherefaceNet-20 from scratch but the performance on LFW cannt reach 99.30%.  Evaluation log is as below:         My training enrironments are:  * network: **SpherefaceNet-20**;  * Training data: CASIA-WebFace, landmarks are obtained via MTCNN (actually I downloaded cropped images from the web, this may be an uncertain factor.)  * GPUs: I use **2 GPUs** and each one processes 256 samples at a single iteration.  * LFW: I download the LFW dataset from its official website and use your provided preprocessing code to process them.    All other seetings are kept the same with your default configurations prototx files, the only thing that  may be not clear is the number of GPUs    There are two suspicious factors that may cause the failure:  1. the actual batch-size. Since I use 2 GPUs x 256 batch-size  2. the training data. I downloaded the cropped images from the web.    Here is my training log <   ___  Additionally, with the released pretrain model `sphereface_model.caffemodel` I only obtain the average accuracy of 99.27. This may be a minor problem and it has been mentioned in < "
"Hey wy1iu,  We are trying evaluate your model, but the performance is not as good as frontal non occluded faces with faces with glasses or partial side faces. Any suggestions to improve the same would be helpful. "
"  !     I think that the lambda is used as a tradeoff between the original softmax and A-softmax.  But how could I adjust the base, power, lambda_min according to different task?  Could you give me some empirical suggestion?"
"I use the same prototxt  as yours, and adjuse the batch size to 128.  Thanks."

"I have tested SpherefaceNet-04 and SpherefaceNet-06 with and without BatchNorm.    Training on WebFace,  SpherefaceNet-04 WITHOUT BN can easily achieve ~98.00% (the paper reports 98.2%),  SpherefaceNet-04 WITH BN        can easily achieve ~98.20% (fine-tuning 98.35%),  SpherefaceNet-06 WITHOUT BN can easily achieve ~98.50% (the paper doesnot give),  SpherefaceNet-06 WITH BN        can easily achieve ~98.70% (fine-tuning 98.80%).    It should be noted that SpherefaceNet-04's forward only costs ~29ms (with BN ~33ms) and SpherefaceNet-06 costs ~49ms (with BN ~55ms), tested on E5-1650V4 3.6GHz, mini-caffe, openblas single thread.

"I tried to train MNIST dataset only with 0-7, and the resulting feature space looks good for 0-7.  however, when I test the network with 8 and 9, they are not discriminative any more.   So I am wondering if this method can generate to new classes?          !       Basically, the problem I am facing is that today I want to verify 100 classes (but not necessary face), and tomorrow I will have to verify 105 classes, and next day more.

"First of all, thanks for sharing the code.  I have trained a model with accuracy 99.27% following the instructions. However, when I use it in C++ programs, I find there is slight difference between C++ and matlab. Loading the same 96*112 cropped image (even .bmp format), the extracted features are not exactly the same between C++ and matlab.  I have written a C++ code following the matlab code `test\code\evaluation.m', and the ACC is 99.08%.  Though this accuracy is also acceptable, I wonder why this happens.    code    "

"Hi,  Thank you for sharing your implementation.    I am new to Caffe so I may have misunderstood, but it would be great if you can kindly clarify this:    In the Large margin paper you mentioned:  `f_yi =[lambda * Wn_yi * xn_i * cost_yi + Wn_yi * xn_i *psi(t_yi)]/(1+lambda) `  Where Wn, xn are normalized forms of W and x and Wn = 1 (for sphereface)    But in the code below,  I observed (for m= 2, lets say)  On line 192   `top_data = XW^t_forall_i`  On line 207 update for yi  `top_data += (XW^t)_iff_i==yi`  But on line 211 again you do:  `top_data += lambda *XW^t`  and then `top_data /=(1+lambda)`    According to this implementation  `f_yi =[Wn_i * xn_i * cost_i + lambda * Wn_yi * xn_i * cost_yi + Wn_yi * xn_i *psi(t_yi)]/(1+lambda) `  and   `f_i =[Wn_i * xn_i * cost_i + lambda * Wn_i * xn_i * cost_i]/(1+lambda)  => f_i = [Wn_i * xn_i * cost_i] `    Even if gradually `lamdba` becomes zero, f_yi still receives `Wn_i * xn_i * cost_i`.   Although I understand if predictions are correction then this contribution will be negligible, but wouldnt this impact the misclassified ones?  Can you please explain why it is so? or am I missing something.       `  caffe_cpu_gemm (CblasNoTrans, CblasTrans, M_, N_, K_, (Dtype)1.,        bottom_data, weight, (Dtype)0., top_data);`    And again:     `caffe_cpu_gemm (CblasNoTrans, CblasTrans, M_, N_, K_, lambda_,        bottom_data, weight, (Dtype)1., top_data);`"

"I test the 20 layers sphereface network on my own database,then test the features on tSNE  that generate by sphereface.But the result on tSNE doesn't perform better than the lcnn model.However it perform better than lcnn models(I trained) on lfw database.The sphereface net I had used is trained on MSceleb database and test on lfw database gets 98.65% acc.why the result of sphereface on the tSNE  doesn't  perform better than lcnn？ Do you have test it on tSNE?"

"Hi authors, I have tried your network structure with sphere loss and it can give similar result which mentioned in your paper. However, when I switched to use common resnet-50 or resnet-101 I can just got LFW score at about 97.xx%.   Did you ever tried any other network structures?     I thought that the problem was caused by small norm(fx) where fx is the 512-dim embedding. As the W is normalized to one in sphereface, fx*W will become very small if norm(fx) is small to affect the total loss value.  According to this I tried two approaches:       1) Normalize fx to a larger value like 32,       2) Use Prelu everywhere and set wd of the bias var in last FC layer to 0 and also remove the last BN layer.     Neither of them can work.   Do you have any idea or give some hints?"
"Hi, @wy1iu, sphereface is quite a great work and i have some questions about the formula derivation in margin_inner_product_layer.

"hello,  there are some paper normalize the features before input Softmax layer, and I think it's make sense because  (1)it will make the feature space more dense which suit for hyperplane to do classification.  (2)all feature be normalized will give larger gradients to hard samples.    I also think these ideas don't conflict with sphereface which depend on angular margin.  Do i think it right? and have you did such experiment?  "

"why the weight_diff is treated seperately according to m (SINGLE, DOUBLE, etc) in LargeMargin_softmax_loss wheras in sphereface, it is treated the same?"
Is there any pretrained model using this sphereface concept? If so how do i get the face embeddings of a custom image using that pre trained model?
"first , i train my model using original softmax  then, i want to finetune it using a-softmax  i intend to initialize the a-softmax's fc6 layer param using the original softmax, but the log says that they don't have the same number of param blobs, I found that margin inner product layer has no bias param blob.  i tried xavier initialization , but when i freeze the layers before fc6 and only learn fc6, the loss cannot converge .Do i have to relax the lr of the layers before fc6? "
"In CenterFace and your SphereFace, your net models are both based on ResNets. But I noticed that neither of you use any BatchNorm layers (which differ from original resnets). I tried to add BatchNorm layers back. but got bad results (loss only converged to about 3.5).  So I'm really curious why BatchNorm layers are not good here. Any idea to explain this?"

"Hi guys,   I tested A-Softmax  loss on CASIA dataset and it really does well, reaching a ~99% performance on lfw without careful tuning. But when I switch to use the MS-Celeb-1M datasets for training(roughly cleaned, 98.8% lfw with Lighten CNN), either the 28-layer net nor the 64-layer net seems not to converge. The 64-layer net is the same as mentioned in your paper.   Have you tried A-Softmax in such large dataset? I am still trying to tune my net but have no idea why it doesn't converge."

"> Specifically, half-space MHE constructs a colinear virtual neuron with opposite direction for every      existing neuron.    Which means if there exists a ``W = {w1, w2, .....}``, the opposite direction is ``W' = {-w1, -w2, ......}``?"

@wy1iu Can someone use directly the output of fc5 to verify if a person is the same across multiple photos (with L2 distance for example)?
Do you have windows build version?

i want to learn how to relize A-softmax loss
"Hello,thanks for your good job.  I have trained sphereface-20 and sphereface-64 with only one GTX1060 or GTX1070,and can get 99.22% 99.32%at LFW.  Now,I want to do this on the machine with 3 GTX1080,but I get some error about it.At the begin of training,the loss is 87.3365 already with nothing changed.It can do training with change type: QUADRUPLE to be SINGLE.Those are my training debug info.  Can anyone tell me why this happen?  Thanks very much.

I have implemented this network in PyTorch and `xavier` for all layer works well for all network configuration expect `64` model (model diverge). And I'm searching reason why it does not work, maybe because of not mixed initialization? I checked other init method and non of them is working.     2. I would like to learn baseline model using pure SoftMax. Did you add any layer between embedding (size 512) and classification layer (size num_class), like PReLu or Dropout? I have learned model (20) without adding anything, but it overfitt ( I split data to train/val set)."

"Hi,    in the figures of your papers you can see that the 3-patch net outperforms the one patch net and you say that the 3-patch feature vector is formed by concatenating the feature vectors of each patch. However, you do not say in your paper how these patches are computed. Do you use a different alignment strategy and train a new net on each type of aligned images or do you introduce a small offset and extract the 3-patch features by just transforming the original image a bit and computing the features with the original net?  Furthermore I get better results when not concatenating the features of the mirrored image. Has anyone experimented on that (patch selection/(not) mirroring) ? "
"It is said only one image is registered for each person (could be the face detected  for the first time), so in this case can I ask whether it is an open set test demo? E.g. the similarity between the registered face and the test titled one is always larger than the pre-set threshold (recognized as the same person). It seems once the face is detected, the recognition result is always right. Looking forward to your reply."

"Hi wy1iu,    Asoftmax is a great work.I have some questions about how to set gamma and power for lambda.  Using the settings in your prototxt  (      base: 1000      gamma: 0.12      power: 1      lambda_min: 5  )  lambda will drop very quickly to lambda_min, is it really possible to converge?   what is the best way to setting these for different networks and different size of training data?    Thanks."
"Hi, @wy1iu @ydwen     Thank you for sharing the code. I have trained a model using 28layer (as the center face) with A-softmax, which works well. However, I have struggled training with the 64layer structure you mentioned in the original paper for several days. Could you please kindly release one of you network architectures in the paper (either 20layer or 36layer or 64layer) so I can compare the difference between the prototxt I wrote from yours.     BTW, it seems there is no pooling layer in your architecture, right? Just using convolution layer of stride 2 instead of pooling?    Thanks in advance!"
"Are you able to explain a couple of bits about the implementation of the `margin_inner_product_layer`?    1) What is `lambda_`?  It looks like it's a constant that decreases w/ the iterations, but doesn't seem to be mentioned in the paper.  ** Edit: Looks like you mix `x'w` and `margin(x'w)` via `(margin(x'w) + lambda_ * x'w) / (1 + lambda_)` where `lambda_` decreases exponentially w/ iterations.  Is that right?  **    2) What is the `type` parameter? (eg. `SINGLE, DOUBLE, TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE`)  I'm guessing this is how you set the value of `m` from the paper? ** Edit: I gather these are ways of implementing the margin for `m={1,2,3,4}`.  Any particular reason why you implemented this way?  Numerical stability? **    Thanks"

"I really grateful that @wy1iu release the code. You and @ydwen are really pushing the Face-Verification forward.     I have some question regarding the paper and the code:  1. What is the major change between L-SoftMax and A-SoftMax. For the equation it look like that in L-SoftMax weight are transformed to norm of weights and in A-SofrMax weight are transformed to normalized weight, right? If this is true, the main motivation was section 3.3 in Large-Margin Softmax Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks?  2. Could you explain how did you choose function ψ (which replace cos(θ))?   3. In both paper you use Taylor Series of cos(mθ) (Eq. 7 in Large Margin), right? What was the idea behind using different degree of series based on margin value? Why not using same for all margin?  4. Here is my intuition behind this both paper: in fact  we just scale the output from Linear layer by matrix of ones with different numbers (<1)  on target classes. Both paper propose different method of scaling (with theoretical explanation). I think that maybe there is possible to make implementation which would just use scale matrix. I must think about it as there are many non-linear operation here.   5. I was thinking about using CenterLoss but using cosine similarity. But then I realized than it is equivalent to SoftMax layer without bias (and SoftMax also compare features to other class center as well, not only target, so it make features even better).  Do you agree with my interpretation?"

"Hello!  Thank you for your paper and code!  I'm planning to read the paper in the next days,  but now I've tested OpenCV implementation of the algorithm and I can say it works a way better than other algos for my videos.  Can you please describe what params can I tune to increase fps rate but maybe sacrifice the precision. Also I have bg subtraction mask, maybe there is a way to utilize it inside the algorithm (with the code tweaks).  OpenCV params are listed here:   "

"Dear @alanlukezic,  Thank you for your nice work. I have question about your code.   How one can inform that your tracker fails to track the target?  I mean that, in some tracking algorithms we can inform when the tracker fails to track the target. For example, by using the L1-disnatce between the visual features of the target and the output of the tracker. More specifically, something like this:     I will really appreciate you if your answer cover your C++ implementation (i.e. both implementations (MATLAB & C++ one)).   "

"Hello there,    I have a question regarding the meaning of ""channel"". I thought it meant the RGB channel, but after looking at the video of channel reliability weights visualization, there are so many of them. I thought there should be only 3 weights, one for each color channel.    If there are so many of them, then, channel can't be the RGB channel.     !     But by reading the code, I still think channel here is really the RGB channel, right?    Then how come the visualization shows so many weights?     Thanks,"

With the default parameters, I used this drawing:       And got this result:       I'd really like something more styled according to the original drawing, but I'm not sure what parameters to use? I can't find an explanation of what the parameters do. I'm going to try increasing style-size from 600 to 960 – will this help? Both the style image and the images I'm styling are very large.    Thank you."
"@DmitryUlyanov Currently a single weight is assigned to all style layers during the training process. Is it possible to assign different weights to different style layers?    For example, if ""style_layers"" = ""relu1_2,relu2_2,relu3_2,relu4_2"", is it possible to use ""style_weight"" = ""2,4,5,3"" so that the weights of the four layers (relu1_2,relu2_2,relu3_2,relu4_2) are 2, 4, 5, 3, respectively, in training? Thanks."

"This is not a issue, just want to say that the new parameter in README generate really good result. Compare to previous default parameter, I used to get image with a lot of broken glasses image, or a lot of fragments. Now it's smooth, even with 1 batch.

"I've tested these on a computer with AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor, with 32G RAM installed, with test.lua, I can get a stylized.jpg in 6 seconds. After reading this post   I think it's possible to generate high resolution images if I have larger RAM. I got a VM running on XenServer, with 32 CPU core(Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7- 4820  @ 2.00GHz) and 64G RAM, but when I ran test.lua with regular params, it was extreamly slow than the former computer. It costs over 15 minutes to generate one single image. What's wrong with that? I noticed the script runs on only single one CPU core, is that normal?

I see that the pretrained model you provided runs at higher resolutions compared to the models I trained for a few style images. What might be the reason for this?Did you use VGG19 or normalised vgg?

"I am attempting to train a model using the default pyramid model with this command (also tried using all defaults):     When I try to generate an image with it, I am getting black output, even though the input image's dimension is a multiple of 32:     The issue occurs if I don't use the image_size flag as well. The weird thing is, it seemed to work a couple times, but now all I get is black output. Using johnson's model does not create the issue, but skip_unpool model also creates blank output.  I have tried creating smaller images to 256, 512 etc. but they are all blank.  I am just trying to figure out how to train the model to achieve results similar to the default model.

"Hi, i find i can't tune the style scale in result using test.lua, also i can't find any option about it or is it possible in theory to scale style after the training procedure?  recently i trained a style, and created the following results on a photo with size 668 x 448 and with its original size 4272 × 2848:  !  668 x 448  !  4272 x 2848  i can understand both of the results are right, and the style is applied correctly. but if i can tune the style scale on large size image as artist using large brush, i think it will be better to user to see consistency between thumbnail(he get this quickly) and the final size result(he get this after a long time).   sorry i don't know if this is mentioned on paper or there is any progress in recently research?

"Hi guys, i meet this certain situation, i confirm an amazing effect on some checkpoint but the training progress is stopped before. so i think if i can continue the training instead of discarding those intermediate result(for example have been trained 8K+ iters) and starting an new one(this will consume more unnecessary time), this will be very helpful to save our time.  or if i missed something in train.lua?   thanks in advance.

"Hi, I noticed a place( in part `Network architecure` in `Section 3.2 Generator network for texture synthesis` ) in your paper on texture nets where you mentioned that you use different scale of noise tensors which are `1/2M, 1/4M, ....`of the image size repectively. However, in your code on texture nets, you do use `noise tensor` of size `M x M`, which is the same as the input image size. Does this means that in your paper, variable `i` should be choosen to be `i = 0， 1, ..., K-1`, other than i starting from index 1 up to K "

Sorry if it is a silly question.."
"Hi,    I have some issues executing your code.  First, I tried to execute your example with modelnet 10 using the command provided. It seemed to work but an advanced epoch the code crash with this error:         I executed the code several times and the error appears randomly, it is not always in the same epoch, also it is not appearing in the same part of the code, here you can see an other example of the error:           I tried different versions of pytorch: 0.2 0.3 0.4. The three versions was installed using pip, and also I tried to execute the code with a compiled from source version (0.2) the same error appears. I am using a machine with: 60gb of ram, Intel Xeon and a titan X with 12gb of ram. Moreover I tried to use different versions of open3d: 0.2.0 and 0.3.0. Finally I modified your sample command and I add edge_mem_limit in order to limit the memory used on the gpu without success.    Also I tested the code using the Sydney Urban Objects example, but in this case, this error is appearing at the begging of the execution:         Please can you give me some hint in order to solve the issues?    Thanks,"

Hi. Great paper and great work. I installed pytorch -0.3 in a conda environment and installed dependencies. The code runs successfully.     I was wondering when the code for generalized graph classification shall be released?

"Hi,     we would like to use densecap to predict caption for already computed bounding boxes.   I tried using the `im_detect()` function in `/lib/fast_rcnn/test.py` which has a `boxes` argument.     I would expect the function to output the same number of boxes as i put in, which does not happen. Instead,  it looks like the network predicts new boxes in the RPN.     I tried setting the `cfg.TEST.HAS_RPN` parameter to `False` in order to load the rois blobs in the `_get_blobs()` function -> The boxes are loaded into `blobs`, but this has no effect on the outcome. Are they used at all in this case?    Do i need to adjust the feature_net (vgg_region_global_feature.prototxt) in some way or set some other parameters in order for the network to work as expected? Or did I miss something else?     Thanks   "

"Hi! This could be a minor question, in the paper it was mentioned the bounding boxes with IoU higher than 0.7 are merged into one. In such cases, how do you merge the caption for each bounding box accordingly during training? Because if I understand correctly each box should originally have one phrase?     Or I got it wrong, there was no merging of the bounding boxes during training phase at all?"

Training crashes on the line:  `outputs = model(inputs, laplacian, mask)`    If we'll look deeper, it crashes here:  `xs = [x, torch.mm(L,x.view(-1, feat)).view(batch, node, feat)]` (167 line of src/utils/utils_pt.py file).    It says `The expanded size of the tensor (64) must match the existing size (503) at non-singleton dimension 0.  Target sizes: [64, 64].  Tensor sizes: [503, 64]`    It is torch.mm failing because L is (64,503,503) and x.view(-1, feat) is (32192, 64). By the way, as i know, torch.mm uses 2D tensors as input, no? Well, does anyone launched that and could advice something?"

"Thank you for wonderful code! `std` and `mean` of boxes are stored in params of last regression layer. When `cfg.TRAIN.RESUME ` is `True`, they should be restored?"

"I don't know what the meaning of ""nongt_dim"" is in _extract_position_embedding_ and _attention_module_embedding_. If it means ""the number of rois that are not ground truth"", how to determine which roi is not ground truth during training. Maybe I misunderstand it. Could anyone help me?"

Hi! This is a great work!  But I wonder why the FPN baseline (2FC + softnms(0.6) ResNet-101) 36.8 mAP is lower than the   ? You both use ResNet101 and pre-computed proposals. Is there anything different in implementation?

My **batchsize**(first_n) is 64. This brings a severe data imbalance problem.  Is it normal? Or I made some mistake?  
Will you provide support for voc format dataset?

"Hi,  I apply the resnet_v1_101_coco_trainvalminus_rcnn_dcn_end2end_relation_learn_nms_8epoch.yaml to train a model. Then using the trained model to inference the test image, I find there are multiple boxes appear on the same object. Do I not train the nms layer thoroughly? So I need to add nms to remove the duplicate boxes."
Does it mean to propose first N proposals or first N detections for one image?  Configs in `resnet_v1_101_coco_trainvalminus_rcnn_end2end_relation_learn_nms_8epoch.yaml`.

Thanks for the implementation.    I downloaded the pre-trained models but the file is not a folder which eval.sh code is asking for and the downloaded file is in a file format which is not accessible.    I think the file gets corrupted after downloading from the drive.    IOError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: 'log_att_d1/infos_att_d1.pkl'
"When I try to train the retrieval model using `bash run_fc_con.sh`, there is a problem before saving model. Actually, line 147 of FCModel.py `xt = self.new_img_embed(fc_feats[k:k+1], fc_feats_d.chunk(batch_size)[k]).expand(beam_size, self.input_encoding_size)` results in the issue, because it reminds that there is no attribute named `new_img_embed`. Also, `fc_feats_d` is an error, because the pycharm says that ""Unresolved reference"".    But after switching `--caption_model fc` to `--caption_model att2in2` in `run_fc_con.sh` file, the issue will be solved, so I think the inference of FC model could be wrong.    BTW, (1) when training retrieval model, why do you need to use the caption model to generate captions?  (2) the image features is extracted before training the model, so I think you do not fine-tune the CNN, right?"
"Thanks for your works! Could you provide "" infos_att_d1.pkl"" for us?"

"Hello,  I am getting good accuracy with CondenseNet on my dataset when training from scratch, but I feel like I could boost the results if I could train from a checkpoint pretrained on ImageNet.  You offer the converted checkpoints on ImageNet, but my understanding of the situation is that I can't use that for transfer learning because its missing some dicts like the optimizer.

But in which part of the code is the implementation of **we connect input layers to all subsequent layers in the network, even if these layers are located in different dense blocks** as mentioned in the paper available. I can see only one place inside the dense layers where **torch.cat** function is used where it connects the inputs inside one dense block. Thanks in advance. "
See:      Weird stuff in the Pytorch API:     ... does not fill in place. So you must do:        
"A question about the _dropping function in the LearnedGroupConv class.  In 88 line: self._mask[i::self.groups, d, :, :].fill_(0)  Why the first dimension of the mask is ""**i::self.groups**""?  I thought it should be ""i * d_out:(i + 1) * d_out"".  Thank you!  "
"Hi,  The paper mentions CondenseNet{light-160*, 182*, light-94, 84} for CIFAR, though is not clear about the details of the architecture. Could you share the architectures and how those results can be reproduced?"
"Hi,     I am facing the following problem when I attempt to train the network with:               The assertion error also occurs in the line 362:         Training and testing images are 64x128, and I also tried by resizing only the training images to 256x256.     It seems to be caused by an inconsistency with the number of classes that I am trying to figure out. In the evaluation, it might occur that there are no samples for some of the test classes, which I noticed it can be problematic for your network if the directory classes do not match properly. A successful solution I have found for this in another dataset I am working is to create the same set of class-directories with exactly the same name both in training `train` and testing `val` partitions, leaving empty those class-directories where there are no samples for that class in testing. In this dataset, however, I get that error which is a bit confusing to me.    Another question I have is whether your network can be used to classify images of classes that exist in the test partition but not in the train partition. For instance, in a dataset where half of the classes are used for training and the other half for testing.    I would appreciate any comment if you have any clue about what might be causing that error and the last question about the classes.    Thanks a lot"
"Hi,  Cool ideas in regard to condense net!    I seem to have an issue running the pretrained network 'converted_condensenet_8.pth.tar'. Running the command:    `python main.py --model condensenet_converted -b 32 -j 20 ~/imagenet/ --stages 4-6-8-10-8 --growth 8-16-32-64-128 --gpu 1 --resume --evaluate-from ../converted_condensenet_8.pth.tar`    Results in an error:    Traceback (most recent call last):       It appears that perhaps the parameters for 'stages' or 'growth' may not be set correctly? Please let me know if you have any insights!"
"Dear @ShichenLiu ,    I did not found any shuffle layer related stuff in models.condensenet, which use layers.LearnedGroupConv as LGC. However, the paper says we should use it clearly. Is it a mismatch?     Thanks"
"Hi @gaohuang  and @ShichenLiu ,     Thank you for great work. I have the following concerns when I try running your code and read your paper:  - Condensation criterion: In the paper, you use L1-norm value of weights within the same group to find column indices for pruning weights with small values. I saw these indices were also applied for the other groups in the code self._mask[i::self.groups, d, :, :].fill_(0).   - Have you tested learned group convolution for larger kernel filters (3x3)?  If yes, how 's about the efficiency?  - In the code, why do you shuffle weights for group lasso loss?  - Why do you drop 50% input channels by CondensingLinear(child, 0.5) for converting models?    Thanks,  Hai  "
"Hi,     I am attempting to reproduce your code for the CondenseNet for training a dataset of 7 classes, and approximately between 100K - 150K training images splitted (non-equally) for those clases. My images consist of bounding boxes of different sizes. For that, first I'm using a similar setting you use to train the ImageNet, pointing to my dataset and preparing the class folders to find the paths properly. I resized all images to 256x256 as you did in your paper. Therefore, this is the command line I use for training the new dataset:    ``  python main.py --model condensenet -b 256 -j 28 lima_train --stages 4-6-8-10-8 --growth 8-16-32-64-128 --gpu 0 --resume  ``    where `lima_train` is a link file pointing to the folder containing all training data splitted in class subfolders as required.    I'm using a datacenter whose GPU nodes use NVIDIA Tesla P100 of 16 GB each, and CUDA 8 with cuDNN. In this sense, I presume the training should not be a problem. I understand that a GPU of 16GB or even 8GB should be enough to train this network, shouldn't be? However, I'm getting the out of memory problem shown below. I modified the parameters to reduce the batch size to 64 and the number of workers according to the machine. Probably I am missing some step or I should modify the command line according to the settings of my data.    I would appreciate any feedback.     Thanks in advance and congratulations for this work.    ``  THCudaCheck FAIL file=/opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1503970438496/work/torch/lib/THC/generic/THCStorage.cu line=66 error=2 : out of memory  Traceback (most recent call last):    File ""main.py"", line 479, in        main()    File ""main.py"", line 239, in main      train(train_loader, model, criterion, optimizer, epoch)    File ""main.py"", line 303, in train      output = model(input_var, progress)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/parallel/data_parallel.py"", line 58, in forward      return self.module(*inputs[0], **kwargs[0])    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/CondenseNet/models/condensenet.py"", line 127, in forward      features = self.features(x)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/container.py"", line 67, in forward      input = module(input)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/container.py"", line 67, in forward      input = module(input)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/CondenseNet/models/condensenet.py"", line 33, in forward      x = self.conv_1(x)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/CondenseNet/layers.py"", line 42, in forward      x = self.norm(x)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/module.py"", line 224, in __call__      result = self.forward(*input, **kwargs)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/batchnorm.py"", line 37, in forward      self.training, self.momentum, self.eps)    File ""/mnt/storage/home/vp17941/.conda/envs/condensenet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py"", line 639, in batch_norm      return f(input, weight, bias)  RuntimeError: cuda runtime error (2) : out of memory at /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1503970438496/work/torch/lib/THC/generic/THCStorage.cu:66  srun: error: gpu09: task 0: Exited with exit code 1  ``"

"Hi. Thanks for the codes and the detailed instruction.    I implemented sparse convolution into my encoder:       `self.training` is set `False` when training and `True` when testing. Variable `mask` is generated outside the network and fed in via `tf.placeholder`. So does `self.lastFeature`.    I tried to measure the inference time with timeline:       !     However, I can't find time records of layers under 'featureEncoder'. And there are two bars captioned unknown, the second of which is strangely long. Some Pooling and LeakyRelu‘s time is also strange, costing nearly 2ms.    !     I wonder how I can get the proper time measurement.

You have an error with TF 1.11.0. It's impossible to build the library.    !     I manage to build it with TF 1.8.0 / 1.9.0 / 1.10.0 but with TF 1.11.0 it's broken
"Hi, I just want to know is there any pytorch version operation of sbnet?"
"I was able to see the claimed speedup in terms of inference times, but there is a huge loss in terms of accuracy. Please see a simple MNIST example where I artificially created the images and masks. I am seeing a precision of about 11% which is as good as random guessing with a 10 class problem. I also tried to train the algorithm longer, but the precision saturates at about 11%. Without using SbNet you can get to a precision of ~80% after a few epochs.          "

"I have built the yolov2 object detector using sbnet, but it takes too long to compute the result of sbnet_module.reduce_mask.  I need to compute sbnet_module.reduce_mask every frame, because the mask change every frame.         When I applied sbnet model on yolov2(darknet) model,   forwarding time was about 1.7 times faster.  However, it took longer than expected to compute the **reduce_mask results** which are needed to perform sparse_gather and sparse_scatter.      Below is my code to compute reduce_mask for conv1s ~ conv5.  Currently, it takes 0.03 sec to execute this code, but it's too slow considering the forwarding time of the detector (detector forwarding time is almost 0.03 sec).  Is there any fastest way to compute sbnet_module.reduce_mask?       "

However, my result means that whenever using sbnet_module.reduce_mask, tensorflow graph grows so that speed has slowed down when detecting with sbnet_module.reduce_mask.

"Hi, I've read that supervised learning methods tend to overfit on the data they are trained on. For example, if you train on CityScapes but evaluate on KITTI, you get bad results. I wonder how your models perform in this kind of situation(different data at testing)? In the paper, there are only results for models trained and tested on the same dataset.    Thank you very much."
"Since many issues are presented about SID, here, I offer my realization.  The alpha and beta are determined from the ground truth, where you should compute the max and min depth value for one certain dataset. When you fine-tune on a new dataset, don't forget to modify the value.  The K setting is shown in the Exp section 4.2.3, 80 is the best.  Though I haven't reproduced the perfect results on NYU v2 because of the different network architecture, it seems this strategy offers the promotion for accuracy.  I also try the learnable alpha and beta value but it seems it varies a lot for different scenes. When the alpha changes stably, I believe it suffers from overfitting.  Using the statistic value of alpha and beta can directly reduce the error since you will not get a too small or too large value. I think it can be deemed as an interesting trick to reduce the accuracy, but I haven't tried whether changing the alpha or beta to a more free value like 0 and 10 is helpful."
"Hi again,    When I was reading the paper a long time ago, a part of loss function didn't make sense to me. I think there is a potentially important typo there. Please confirm if I am correct or wrong.    In equation (2) the second term should be:  `SIGMA (1- log(P) )` instead of  `SIGMA(log(1-P))`    Let's assume if a true depth is k (in uniform distribution),  you want:       and       This means there is a typo because your equation will give you` log(0) for Pi when i>k-1` which will be infinity in LOSS.

"hello, thank you for your excellent work~  I have some problem about accuracy of protonet. when i use Resnet12 as backbone to train protonet from scratch with 30way-1shot, i found the best accuracy is roughly 49%. However, the best acc in your paper can arrive 62%, maybe use pre-train model? in other words, i need pretrain model like traditional CNN in training set and use it in training protonet if i want to get 62% ?  sorry to bother you, I hope I have already clarified the issue thoroughly. :)"
"　　Hello, thank you for your thoughtful paper and open code. I have gained a lot after reading it, but I have some questions to ask you  　　First, about pre training, if I don't load the pre training model, the accuracy of res12 and convnet used by feat in the backbone network is 47% and 59% respectively, which is far lower than 80% of RESNET loaded with the pre training model. I  understand that pre training can speed up the training speed, but why it can greatly improve the accuracy. Then I see that there is a pretrain.py  in the project , so can I use my own data to train the model？  !   In the code here, the training set does not follow the small sample k-ways-n-shot method, but sends all data into the training in batches. Just like the ordinary CNN training, why not follow the feat training method？What should I pay attention to when I train with my own data set？  　　Second, as for the feat model, I carefully read the code and found that instead of using transformer completely, simply used multiheadattention to input the proto to generate a new proto. I can simply understand that using self-attention strengthens the correlation between prototypes.and about loss fucntion？  !   Here you use the prototype loss function + regularization function. I looked at the regularization function. It uses all the data of the support set and query set to average the prototype, and then calculates the Euclidean distance with these data sets. Is this loss function obviously helpful to improve the accuracy of the model, or may it not be obvious?Thank you for your reply    "

"首先和感谢您的工作以及代码的开源，帮助学习到了很多，但是对论文中的transductive FSL 的描述很迷惑，还望帮忙解决下：  论文附录里关于transductive的描述如下：  When classifying test instance xtest in the transdutive scenario, other test instances Xtest from the N categories would also be available. Therefore, we enrich the transformer’s query and key/value sets  Q=K=V=Xtrain∪ Xtest  In this manner, the embedding adaptation procedure would also consider the structure among unlabeled test instances.When the number of shots K >1, we average the embedding of labeled instances in each class first before combining them with the test set embeddings.  针对以上描述，有以下几个困惑：  1、other test instances Xtest from the N categories would also be available中other test instances Xtest是指什么，是来自支持集5类中的其他图片吗，那这不是相当于扩充了训练时候支持集的shot数？  2、other test instances Xtest有标签吗？需要进行预测的是test instance xtest，那没有标签的xtest的信息就未用到，所以怎么体现transductive呢。  3、When the number of shots K >1, we average the embedding of labeled instances in each class first before combining them with the test set embeddings.中，先平均支持集嵌入，然后与test set embeddings结合计算更好的类中心，这样把test set用来计算类中心了不是就已经知道它的标签了，还怎么预测呢。    在实验介绍部分描述如下：  Based on the adapted embedding by the joint set of labeled training instances and unlabeled test instances, we can make predictions with two strategies. First, we still compute the center of the labeled instances, while such adapted embeddings are influenced by the unlabeled instances (we denote this approach asFEAT†,which works the same way as standardFEATexcept the augmented input of the embedding transformation function);Second, we consider to take advantage of the unlabeled instances and use their adapted embeddings to construct a better class prototype as in Semi-ProtoNet (we denote this approach asFEAT‡).    1、Based on the adapted embedding by the joint set of labeled training instances and unlabeled test instances,问题同上面3，这种和unlabeled test instances怎么进行结合，如果是一起用来计算类原型的，那岂不是已经知道它的标签就无需预测了；  2、FEAT、FEAT†和FEAT‡的具体区别是哪里不同？    综上就是，在transductive的设置上具体是怎样进行设置，怎样来进行查询集的预测的？  读了很多遍都没理清其关系，真的很困惑，万分期待您的回复！    "

"Great work!  I have some confusion about the code implementation on contrastive loss.   In the paper, it is suggested that the loss acts on `instances embeddings after adaptation`.

"Thanks for the excellent work.     In your paper, I noticed that you pre-trained the backbone to initialize its weights rather than training the backbone from scratch, is that right?  As can be seen from Table 1, the pre-trained ProtoNet has achieved comparable performance to those of SOTA approaches, which makes me believe that the pre-training strategy has a big impact on the performance improvement. If so, will the classification accuracies drop without the pre-training? Are there any evaluation results of the proposed method without using the pre-training strategy from the beginning?      "
"I am going through the code of testing part and I wanted to know which images are incorrectly classified by model.

Can we plot confusion matrix during testing in FEAT model setup?  As we are doing testing based on episodes and in each episode we are using different combination of classes. Any pointer regarding confusion matrix generation.
感谢你们提供FEAT源码！我尝试用自己的数据集，SEEN(train)有两类，UNSEEN(validate)有4类。 我在SEEN classes上做预训练  `python3 pretrain.py --dataset CustomizedData --lr 0.001 --batch_size 128 --max_epoch 600 --schedule 170 300 400 500 --gamma 0.1 --backbone_class ConvNet`  得到  [dist] val acc = 0.5646  [sim] val acc = 0.5758  然后用此模型做FEAT  `python3 train_fsl.py  --max_epoch 200 --model_class FEAT --use_euclidean --backbone_class ConvNet --dataset CustomizedData --way 2 --eval_way 4 --shot 5 --eval_shot 5 --query 15 --eval_query 15 --balance 0.1 --temperature 32 --temperature2 64 --lr 0.0001 --lr_mul 10 --lr_scheduler step --step_size 20 --gamma 0.5 --gpu 14 --init_weights ./saves/initialization/miniimagenet/con-pre.pth --eval_interval 1`  只能在epoch 7 得到最高acc = 0.6272  请问有什么修改建议可以提高准确率吗？    还有另一个问题，请问如果像我这么正常运行是没有用到test集的吧？

I have questions about the labels used in meta-training stage, I find you didn't use gt_label in your code.  you put gt_label in cuda(data, gt_label = [_.cuda() for _ in batch]), when computing cross_entropy, you use other labels(loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, label)), which is prepared by prepare_label func, this is very weird    "
"Hi, Dr. Ye  Your nice work brings me a lot of inspiratons. Thank you very much!    I have tried to reproduct the results of the ProtoNet with the pre-trained weights of ResNet12 you provided.

"Hi thanks for the great work!    I read your code very carefully but i am really confused here. In the resnet-12.py file, the forward function is like this:         and         you can see here the default argument for avg_pool is false. Thus the output feature vector is 5*5*640 dimension instead of 640, which is claimed in your papers.

"Hi thanks for the great work!    I went through the github issue and found someone asked the same question.

But for 5way 5shot i cannot reach 80. Also when i look at the curve of training acc/error and validation acc, i found they actually change very little through the whole training process and the best validation epoch is basically the first 5 epochs. Just wondering is this behaviour normal or similar to your end?    Thanks in advance!"
"I see in the prepare_model we have:     later we have      what is the difference between `self.para_model` and `self.model`, and why we have  `self.model.train()` at the beginning , but in the   `prepare_model(args)` we have `model = eval(args.model_class)(args)`, why we use `eval` here and then `.train()`. can you please explain it?

I was wondering what does the cash do and if I need to use it?
"Thanks for sharing your code, it is so useful and great.  I'm new to FSL, I think I understand most of the stuff about it and I know what is query and support.

I don't understand this. does `instance` define as `query+support`? if so, I guess for each instance (query+suppor) we have (5 support + 1 query), am I correct? and then `15*6` should be `90`? can you please explain what I'm missing here, where the `80` comes from?    In this case (input = `80x3xwxh`), the outputs of model is `logits` and `reg_logits` which are in the shape of `75x5` and `80x5`. would you also explain what those dimensions represent?

How can I test the model after meta-training?
"Hi, thanks for this work.  I have tried to use the pretrained weights directly in a prototypical network on 1-shot miniImageNet. The result is about 59% when using Res12 and 55% when using WRN. I wonder if this is reasonable since WRN is a deeper network compared to Res12."

"Thanks for sharing the nice paper and implementations.    I have a question for your shared code pretrain.py    It seems that your default argparse setting of pretraining is set to 1e-3 and decay 0.1 in 30, 50, 80 epochs.    I found that it yields lower accuracy of pretrain phase train/valid/test in MiniImageNet or TieredImageNet.    Is there any special reason to set you 1e-3 for initial learning rate or bigger lr (e.g. 1e-1) will works better?"
It seems like `eval_feat.py` doesn't work currently.    Also I am not able to reproduce evaluation results for feat* with the pretrained models. Can you check whether this currently works?

I think your provided weights for the initialisation are mixed with your final weights.    The README states:  1) Pre-trained weights are here -    2) The learned models are here -      For MiniIMageNet-Res-5-Shot-5-Way.pth at the very least these appear to be the wrong way round.    Can you confirm?
"@Han-Jia , Thanks for your source code! But I have some troubles in reproducing them.  I have achieved only **51.97%** for the 1-shot 5-way of ConvNet case and **70.60%** for 5-shot 5-way of ConvNet case.  The hyper-parameters I used is:    - --lr 0.0001 --temperature 32 --max_epoch 200  step_size (schedulr) = 10, gamma=0.2 for 1-shot 5-way of ConvNet    - --lr 0.0001 --temperature 32 --max_epoch 200  step_size (schedulr) = 10, gamma=0.2 for 5-shot 5-way of ConvNet    Should I make any changes to other default parameters to reproduce the result in Table1 (**52.61%** and **71.33%** test acc)?    any information will be greatly appreciated"

"Hi, I think the code in this repo corresponds to the results of FEAT*, because I can only get about 62.57%  when I evaluate for  1-shot -5-way with ResNet, and the model is trained by the script of the repo provided.  So, I wonder how to get the results of FEAT?  Much appreciated!"
"Hello  I have tried to reproduce the model pre-training instead of using your provided parameters. However, I could not get ideal results. I wanna illustrate what I have done to see whether I was doing something wrong.    There are 64 training class with 600 images each. So I add a 640*64 fc layers after  the feature encoder and use this model to train a standard classification network with 64*600 images.   For validation, I drop the fc layers and use the encoder as the prototypical network to monitor the performance on 16 val classes.  The val performance could at most reach 46 % at pre-training stage. Training loss and acc could easily  overfit to 0 and 1.  When I use this encoder to initialize the FEAT, the val performance could at most reach  50.3.   So I am wondering if I understand your pre-training stage correctly. Thank you very much.  "

"Hi, you have done an amazing work! I really like this work. If possible, could you please send me the  well-trained models (protoNet, matchingNet and FEAT) and optimal hyperparameters in training (like temperature)?"
"Hi Fusheng,    We have released the pre-trained model's weight  . Our pretraining procedure is basically the same as  , trained on 64 training classes and validated on 16 validation classes. Model selection is based on nearest neighbor classifier's result (accuracy) on 16 validation classes. Please refer to   repo for your reference of implementation details.    _Originally posted by @hexiang-hu in      Hi hexiang,    I am planning to implement the pretraining by myself.  The repo you list seems not applicable for training a wide residual net used in the paper  Hence, I am not sure if I understand the pretraining procedure correctly.  Is it true that I just need to add a 640*64 linear layer after the embedding (model.endoder) and then train the 64-way classifier under the cross-entropy loss?    Any information will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!"
"Hi~  The  reported result in the paper seems very competitive. But I have some troubles in reproducing them.   Could you kindly share the settings (e.g. temperature) for achieving ProtoNet results reported in Table 1？    Also, I am a bit confused about the usage of temperature parameter.  In the paper, the temperature scalar is said to be used as  logits=  distances* temperature   and temperature is chosen from {0.1, 1, 16, 32, 64, 128}.    But in the code, it seems to be used as   logits =  distances/ temperature   In this case, should the temperature still be chosen from {0.1, 1, 16, 32, 64, 128}?    Thanks!"

Hello :)    Where can we download the Seeing through fog dataset instead of using the official website?    I tried to register but received the following e-mail:     
Thanks for the great work!    I want to know how the depth maps are obtained in supplementary 5.1.
"@MarioBijelic   First of all thank you for the dataset in adverse weather. I am planning to make use of the friction data provided in the dataset, however is there a way to map the friction data with location or GPS data ?   Also I assume that the friction data corresponds to the friction values under vehicle and time synchronized with the image and velodyne data under the same name."
"Hi, many thanks for your great work!    As for the quatitative detection AP listed in your paper, which dataset is used? The daytime split, night split or both of them?  And in the training stage, both the daytime and the night data are used?    THX."
"Hi, thanks for your impressive work! The dataset is so well-collected with novel preprocessing tools developed.    I would like to use the dataset in my research work, but I registered and it said the download link will be sent to my email. But I did not received any link or email. I have also checked the junk box so it is not missed. Is there any problems? Thanks.    Btw, if the network mentioned in the paper ""Seeing through Fog"" can be released, it would be even more helpful for our to follow your work.    Looking forward to your reply, thanks"
read.py only retrieves up to the 26th element of the labels (i.e 'visibleLidar': kitti_properties[25] ). What is the 27th element supposed to be (kitti_properties[26])? visibleRadar?   
"In the supplementary material, it says that a homography map between gated and RGB was calculated to warp gated into the RGB plane. Is this transformation matrix provided anywhere?     It also says that RGB was cropped into gated FOV. Was there any resizing done at all prior to cropping or was it just a simple crop? "
"Hello,    I am very impressed by your work in the SeeingThroughFog paper. I am working on training an SSD model using only Camera Stereo Images to learn from your work. I have found 14 different classes in the dataset ('LargeVehicle', 'PassengerCar_is_group', 'RidableVehicle', 'Pedestrian', 'Pedestrian_is_group', 'PassengerCar', 'Vehicle', 'Obstacle', 'RidableVehicle_is_group', 'Vehicle_is_group', 'LargeVehicle_is_group', 'DontCare', 'train', 'person'). I was trying to understand the label classes, but I have few questions. How many classes have you used for training? What is the difference between label class 'PassengerCar' and 'Vehicle'? What does the label 'Vehicle_is_group' exactly mean?     Also, while generating TFRecord files for Lidar and Radar data, did you gave input as a projected 2D image?      Thank you very much. Looking forward to hearing from you back!"
"Currently, the dataset is given with no documentation on what each folder contains. Can we add to the README.md a short description of what the data in each folder represents, and if its used in the paper or not? This would allow for students and researchers to use this dataset without trying to match back and forth between the paper/exploratory github code and the dataset (which currently has a bit of educated guesswork involved).     For example, right now, I don't know what the difference is between the lidar_hdl64_strongest and lidar_hdl64_strongest_stereo_left. Likewise, gated_full_rect and gatedX_rect. This documentation would elucidate these types of questions.       I think a good method to document this would simply be a table format like this:     Folder | Used for Training | Used for Testing | Description |    ---|---|---|---|  cam_stereo_left | yes | yes | 8-bit RGB images captured from the left stereo cameras. cam_stereo_left_lut is derived from this...  fir_axis | no | no | 8-bit Thermal infrared images  gated0_rect | yes | yes | gated infrared images. Different from gated1_rect, gated2_rect and gated_full_rect in these ways: ....  ... | ... | ...| ...|  FOLDER_X | ?| ?| Description of FOLDER_X |    If any of the author's would be interested in spending 15-20 min to guide me through this dataset, I would be more than happy to submit a PR for this addition myself.

"Hi,    since the strongest and last returns are stored in different files with different counts of points per point cloud I'm having trouble matching them together, to find out e.g. what the corresponding last return is for a strongest return yielded by the same laser beam. Is it possible to somehow reconstruct this information?

There is an issue with frame_id `2018-02-04_10-02-19_00000` in the _validation_day_ split.    The LiDAR scan misses many points and the ground truth 3D boxes do not contain any points.    !     I will exclude this frame in my LiDAR only 3D object detection pipeline.

"Hi! Radar targets have the following information: rcsLog, azimuthAngle_sc, rVelOverGroundOdo_sc, x_sc, y_sc, x_cc, y_cc and rDist_sc.

I'm particularly not sure whether I should use x/y_cc or x/ y_sc when comparing to **posx** and **posy** from the labels in gt_labels/cam_left_labels (e.g. to count how many radar points are inside a bounding box).     In tools/DatasetViewer/lib/read.py, the function load_calib_data mentions four coordinate frames: _zero_, _camera_, _velodyne_ and _radar_.

I am interested in this question. Do you have any comments or suggestions?"
"I appreciate your excellent work on text editing. I tried to run FANnet with pretrained model on your datasets.  So I downloaded the pretrained weights from   and datasets from   following README.    To generate results using the valid set as the input, I modified `fannet.py` and  ran the following code      But the SSIM value `sv` is far from what was claimed in the paper.

"Thank you very much for your contribution in this field.  I still have some questions about the character replacement part. As you said in the paper, when training fannet and colornet, the input character size is 64*64, but when performing character replacement in a real scene, some characters are much larger in size 64*64 (for example, 128*128), how did you solve this situation? Is it to directly resize the generated characters to 128*128 or some other way?"
"Hello, prasunroy. Thank you for the amazing work. I tried to train fannet by `python stefann/fannet.py` following your codes, but got `ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable` and it stopped training.  Could you give me a solution to fix the bug？    !   "
Is it necessary to restart the program after processing one image?  How to run it continuously?

"Hi, I am new to python and machine learning. I find this idea very useful to calculate the gradient at not just the final layer but at the intermediate layers of GAN too. If I am not wrong it means that you calculate loss between let's say: Gen3 (generator intermediate layer 3) and Dis3 (discriminator intermediate layer 3) and calculate the gradient update for that layer only. In simple words the loss is being calculated at each layer. Please correct me if I am wrong.    The problem is I am unable to find this implementation in the code provided. Could you please help in understaing the confusion? "
"I'm currently working on an own implementation of your great paper during which I came up with the question, if the second generator pass in each training step is actually necessary. What I mean is, that we generate fake samples once to optimize D and then once again to do so for G. But for the second case, the weights of G actually haven't changed so the drawn fakes won't differ either. It would be different, if we used different latent samples for each pass, but this does not seem to be the case.    From my current understanding, we could simply retain the gradients from the first pass and avoid one costly generator call, reducing the computational resources by 25% or something per training iteration. But I have to admit, that I'm more familiar with your PyTorch implementation of the paper, which I took as a reference, to clarify on this question. Nonetheless, I'm asking here, as it seems to be ""official"" repository."

"Hello, we are currently working on motion prediction problems using nuScenes dataset.    We are interested in the nuScenes dataset because it has rich semantic information of the environment in its map expansion with 11 layers of non-geometric diving data. One thing we are currently looking into is the lane data of the map, especially the lane connectivity. What we found is that nuScenes has the concept of “lane_connector”, which is used to connect lanes in special road areas like intersections. However, this lane_connector has rather less semantic information, and current map_api in nuscenes dev-kit does not have a good support for visualizing the lane_connector.    We made some changes in the map api to visualize the polygon associated with the lane_connector. It seems to us that the shape of the lane connector is rather like a patch box, not a road element.     So we have three questions as shown below.  1. Do you have an idea that how the lane_connector is generated ?  2. How to generate the center lines of lane_connector as normal lane? (For normal lane, it has get_arcline_path function to get centerlines or baseline paths)  3. Can lane_connector represents turning information, we notice that in the intersection area, one lane can have two lane connectors (Does this mean that these two lane connectors are representing two different turning directions?)    Great Thanks"

"Hi,   I examined that some frames have bad (wrong) lidar annotations regarding measurement points, which are invalid (for instance the laser beam didn't come back as for very remote targets or when hitting very reflective surfaces such as car windows.    The NuScene data set is dealing with invalid data (e.g. measurements which did not return) by labelling them with 31 (ego_vehicle).  In fact points belonging to those invalid measurements have a radius close to zero.    Here is an example from ""scene-1073"", sample 4:  - Upper image: plotting the log10 of the radii of lidar measurements using phi-theta coordinates (1084-1087 phi points, 32 theta points),  Black spots correspond to invalid data as radius is below 10^-4 meter   - Lower image: annotation of ego (1) and vegetation (2) is plotted).    !     From the image it is clear, that in the upper part lidar is shooting in the sky black spots. The labels here should not be vegetation but Ego vehicle (or the class corresponding to invalid data).    This is sample 1 of the same scene, providing a correct (consistent) annotation  !   Note that the radii of non-valid points (ego_vehicle) are not scaled down to 10^-5 in this sample    "

I observe it is mentioned in the challenge that annotations are not provided for the test split. The `sample_annotation.json` is also an empty list in `v1.0-test`.

"I would like to check if it is possible to calculate false positives by considering ground truth and predicted bounding boxes that are very close by but are the wrong class.    From what I understand, the current evaluation (  finds the closest bounding box of the same class (line 81) and checks if it is close to the ground truth box. Using the distance threshold, we can tweak the sensitivity of the prediction being a true or false positive.    However, is it possible to consider boxes that aren't the same class to be false positives as well? For example, if a `bus` box is predicted right on top of a `car` ground truth, can this be used as an indication of a false positive too?

The question is why do we label the occluded parts? Because I noticed some datasets only label the visible parts of the objects.

"Hi motional team, I'm curious what is the velodyne hdle32 lidar scan pattern serialization format?

Concretely, at every scan we have around 695000 / 20 = 34000 lidar points.   - point 1 is the first channel ring index at 0 degrees azimuth and 10 degrees vertical elevation angle  - point 2 is the first channel ring index at 0 degrees azimuth and 9.9 degrees vertical elevation angle.  ...  - point 34000 is the last channel ring index at 360 degrees azimuth and -30 degrees vertical elevation angle?   "
"For most LiDAR sensors, a large portion of points (~10% give or take) will fall below the signal to noise ratio/hit air and will be classified as noise. This either results in a) the LiDAR point clouds varying significantly in size and/or b) a lot of points being classified as the same NOISE value e.g. [0, 0, 0] in the LIDAR point cloud.     For the nuScenes data, it seems that all LiDAR scans are around 35000 points and there are no repeated common NOISE values. I'm curious where these noisy LiDAR point clouds are/were they filtered by the LiDAR sensor itself? "

"Hi, I am confused about the meaning of 'ego_pose' in different sensors.  For  a specific sample, I can get ego_pose respect to the CAM_FRONT by:    `cam_front_pose= self.nusc.get('ego_pose', self.nusc.get('sample_data', record['data']['CAM_FRONT'])['ego_pose_token']))`  At the same time, I can get ego_pose respect to the LIDAR_TOP by  `lidar_pose = self.nusc.get('ego_pose', self.nusc.get('sample_data', record['data']['LIDAR_TOP'])['ego_pose_token'])`  And I can get ego_pose w.r.t CAM_BACK, CAM_FRONT_LEFT in the same way.  Here comes the question.   1. What's the difference of these ego_poses? What's the meaning of these ego_poses of the same sample? They look quite similar with little differences.   2. I observe that in many cases where coordinate system transformation is need, points coordinates are first transformed to global and then transformed back to ego coordinates system, finally transform to specific sensor.  E.g. lidar -> global -> ego -> cam. Why not transform by ego coordinates system since all the sensors are calibrated respected to ego coordinate system, like lidar - > ego -> cam? This is related to the first problem because the ego_pose w.r.t. different sensors are slightly different.      "

"Hello,    I am trying to implement a prediction mechanism for stationary objects. The idea is as follows:  1- Get the timestamp of the keyframe X and keyframe X-1 (two consecutive frames having 0.5 seconds time difference). Keyframe X is the current frame.  2- Get the ego-pose of both frames using the timestamp. The ego-poses are already given in the dataset in terms of translation + rotation(quaternion). I convert quaternions to rotation matrices, merge with translations to create the 4x4 transformation matrix for both ego-poses, where the last row of them is always   to calculate the matrices.   3- Get the relative positions of detected objects at keyframe X-1 with respect to the ego-vehicle's coordinate system at keyframe X-1. These relative positions are basically the output of the neural network.  4- Now I want to calculate the relative positions of detected objects with respect to the ego-vehicle's coordinate system at keyframe X. In other words, I am trying to calculate what would be the output of the network for keyframe X. I calculate the transformation matrix from the coordinate system at X-1 to X follows:    transformation = torch.matmul(torch.inverse(past_egopose), cur_egopose)  I also tried:  transformation = torch.matmul(torch.inverse(cur_egopose), past_egopose)    5- And then, I apply this transformation to the previous detection results:    predicted_object_poses = torch.matmul(transformation, object_poses)    However, I am unable to do correct predictions which I verified through visualization. The results are 1-2 meters away from what they should be. Do you see anything wrong with my method?    Best regards,    UPDATE: It seems I am missing the transformation from ego vehicle to lidar.

I don't know which function to use for what. If you can provide me some starting points, guidelines or refer some tutorials/github repos that would be great. Thanks in advance!    Best,  Emre"
"Hi, thanks for attention! I'm new in using Lidar data to machine learning,  so my problem may be trivial to you, or even some don't make sense.    I want to do object detection mission, and I am trying giving 3D bounding box to the raw Lidar data. And I use  `v1.0-mini`. My questions are:    1. Do every point clouds in  `.pcd.bin` file have labels? For example, the exact point cloud is a vehicle. Or they only have the ground truth boxes data like:       2. How to use the bounding box to train the model?           I want give bounding boxes to point clouds, just like what we do in CV object detection mission. But the difference between point clouds and pictures is that point clouds stored in `.pcd.bin` file are unordered. So my question is: how to train a model that can give bounding box to raw point clouds, so that I can let the computer know that this point clouds cluster forms a vehicle, and the others forms a motor?   Is there any code sample?    3. Is it possible for me to make a dataset that every point cloud is labeled?   "

"This issue is about `arcline_path_utils.py`    So far as I know, each `arcline_path` is divided into 3 segment. To get the coordinates of  a pose at `s` meters along the arcline path, first find out which of the 3 segment this pose is located, then calculate the arcline path distance from the starting point of the segment found.  Let's denote the radius of the curvature of the segment as `r` and assume the shape of the segment is `L` (left).     Then function `get_transformation_at_step()`  will output the `xy` distance from the starting point of the segment after **Rotation Transformation**：(`sin\theta` * `r`,   `(1-cos\theta)` * `r`, `theta` )    Finally, function `apply_affine_transformation()` will output the final coordinates.  My confusion is indeed about the `apply_affine_transformation()` function:  My understanding is `pose[2]` is the **yaw** of  the starting pose，why does this function rotate the distance (`sin\theta` * `r`,   `(1-cos\theta)` * `r`)  by  `pose[2]` radians counterclockwise? why rotate the distance? why rotate `pose[2]` radians?       Is there any tutorial or illustration of this process?    "

In map_api the connectivity only tells incoming and outgoing lanes, but I somehow need to access neighbouring lanes as well - any idea how I can achieve that?    Update: the way I approach this is by retrieving all lanes in a patch, then store the node tokens of all of their lane divider segments and look for matches in another loop (e.g. find if any lane `lane_a` has a right_lane_divider_segments overlapping with some other lane `lane_b`'s left_lane_divider_segments, if yes then I call `lane_b` the right neighbour of `lane_a`).

"Hi!    I'm trying to match bounding boxes from a pertained YoLo network to the 2D projections of bounding boxes in NuScenes.

"I am attempting to utilize the PointPillars Detections (  Detections download. pointpillars-val.json) to analyze the performance of my deterministic tracking system, and am running into a case where there are hundreds of detections, but only a single annotated object in the sample sample frame.     I am utilizing ijson to parse the raw json file provided, splitting up the detected objects in a given sample frame and writing it to a ROS bagfile which I can then utilize for evaluating my tracking system.

Since each detection begins with the sample_token it will show all the scene results frame and all detections from that frame. Which also displays this high number of results.

"Hi, I think L1323 to L1325 in `python-sdk/nuscenes/nuscenes.py` might use the wrong `rotation_vehicle_flat_from_vehicle`. If my understanding is correct, `rotation_vehicle_flat_from_vehicle` is the transformation (without translation) from the ego body frame `E` to an ego body frame `E'` with a zero yaw such that the z-axis is parallel to the world frame `W`.     The current code is         I think L1323 to L1325 should be         instead of your version,    to firstly map the points in `E` to `W`, then `W` to `E'`.    If I am right, this mistake is not obvious to catch because the roll and pitch are very close to zeros such that `rotation_vehicle_flat_from_vehicle` is almost an identity matrix. But you can still observe the small difference in the visualization.    Thanks!"

Is there a standard about how and why those vehicle instances are filtered out, e.g., near the end of frames, static without movement?

"The Detection eval script prints along the lines the following statement:     This is very misleading because it sounds like only LIDAR points are counted. When e.g. manually filtering ground truths via LIDAR points and then feeding this back to the eval routine results in a non-perfect score. This is very irritating, and a simple code inspection does not easily reveal that actually RADAR points are taken also into account, as it is hidden behind the variable name ""num_pts"".    I would suggest to simply update the printed statement to        "
"Hello, I'm trying to evaluate a model trained and tested on nuScenes on only the blobs of part 06. However, I'm uncertain from which scene (Scene number) does part 06 start and at which scene does it end? Can you please inform me? Thanks, in advance."
"Hello, the staff of nutonomy!      I am working on the lidar-seg dataset in my project. And I want to get the range view image of current frame by projecting point clouds into front-view. As range image is the native form of rotated lidar data, I want to know whether there is a official transformation code about the process. Thanks a lot !"
"Hi @holger-motional ,  Is there a way to export annotations as text files?  I have seen the export to kitti  file. But velocity of each box is not included in the output.  I would like to have text files with velocity labels also.  Thanks."
"Hi, thanks for the great devkit. I have two questions:    1. I cannot find the exact mounting position of the LiDAR sensor in the documents. Specifically, I am interested in the height above ground. I see that this was somehow mentioned   already, however it only states the height of the ego-vehicle roof and not the LiDAR mounting position.    2. Maybe I missed it, but I wasn't able to see a link on the website that points to the technical data sheet of the exact LiDAR sensor that was used to capture the dataset. Since it is a Velodyne VLP-32, I was wondering if   contains the information about the same sensor as used for nuScenes.    Thanks for your help."
"When I map lidar data to the camera_front plane, a sparse depth map is generated.  But it seems that the generated depth map is so sparse that it is invalid for me to use the same depth completion method as Kitti.  How can I convert sparse depth map to dense depth map？  What is the range of the depth map？"
Is there a method for 2D object detection on nuscense dataset?  Or is there a comparison of 2D object detection on nuimage?  I found that the 2D annotation converted from 3D annotation in nuscenes dataset can't fit the object well. Can I use the converted data for 2D detector training?
How can I read 2D annotation information of front camera image?  From nuscenes to 3D annotation conversion or 2D annotation in nuimage
Does the image in nuscenes correspond to the image in nuimage?  How can I generate depth map of image plane from LIDAR point cloud image?

"Hello nuscenes-devkit team.    I am trying to test my KITTI-trained model on v1.0-mini nuscenes dataset. And I have some question listed as follow:    1.  I used your export_kitti.py code to convert the nuscenes data into KITTI format. As I checked, there are only 10 nuscenes data is converted to KITTI format. Whether the small number of data is related to the v1.0-mini version of nuscenes?  2. Then, I used the converted data to test my model. The detector could get AP>80% when evaluated on KITTI dataset. Whereas, the detector tested on nuScenes the results weird, which is copied as below. Do you have any ideas why the results show like this?      When I further see the visualized result, it shows many objects are incorrectly detected, which leads to the low AP.  !      3. As you illustrated in the export_kitti.py, the function kitti_res_to_nuscenes() could be used to convert kitti results. I am a little bit confused about what do you mean by the 'kitti results'. Do you mean the .pth model trained on kitti dataset? What kind of kitti result does this code need?    Thanks in advance."

Hello!    Do I understand correctly that I can only train MTP and CoverNet models on my own to get some results?

"I have a question about the method for computing recall.  The recall is calculated as `recall = num_matches / num_objects` in function `motar` in module `nuscenes/eval/tracking/metrics.py` and the scores used for computing recall levels are also selected only by `matches = events[events.Type == 'MATCH']` in function `accumulate_threshold` in module `nuscenes/eval/tracking/algo.py`.   However, in py-motmetrics, the recall is calculated as `num_detections / num_objects` in function `recall` in module `motmetrics/metrics.py` with `num_detections = num_matches + num_switches`, and this is the same as the method proposed in paper `Evaluating Multiple Object Tracking Performance: The CLEAR MOT Metrics`.   So, why not to compute recall using the same method as py-motmetrics?  Thanks.  "

"Hello,  As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I'm currently working with nuScenes dataset and trying to convert the dataset into KITTI format. Indeed, I converted the dataset into KITTI format. However the 3D Boxes in the 2D images don't seem to be enclosing the object of interest correctly. Is this normal and expected?

"Hi,    I would like to ask how the dataset of map expansion was generated (both png file and json file. ) In map_api.py stated that the WGS 84 Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection as Google Maps/Earth was used. However, by using google earth I can only export map in kml data format instead of png format. Moreover, how could we find the detailed information of the map (e.g. non geometric layer, geometric layer, ....) and turn it into json file?    Hope that someone can help me with this problem.

"Hi! I am recently trying to access the point clouds that are not in the key frames, and I am confused by the question below. Thank you for your help!    The paths to the LiDAR data are different when using different interfaces.

Therefore, I am wondering **which approach is right and what are the differences**?    1. The first approach is by the following code. Specifically,         2. The second approach is by the function `get_sample_data_path`. Specifically,    "
"Hi, I download dataset here:   I want to project the 3d box and point cloud onto the image to verify the accuracy of the label.  code is :     The results seems not good.  1.

"Hey,  I'm trying to understand the relation between the prediction challenge and the cameras on the vehicle    In the prediction challenge, we're trying to predict the trajectories of some agent in the scene.

If they are not the same one, is the agent on which we predict trajectories present in the images? can we use them for the prediction challenge?"
"Hi!     Thank you for your help on this dataset! It is very helpful to all the people! However, I have some questions that may need your help, and I indeed haven't found them in the tutorials.    I am wondering how to access the point clouds that are not in the key frames, i.e., samples. The original LiDAR scans the surrounding environment at a frequency of 10Hz, but the samples only have a frequency of 2Hz. Specifically, I am curious about the following two questions:    1. **How to access the data related to LIDAR_TOP but not in the key frames (samples), such as point clouds, ego poses, time stamps?**  2. **May I believe that ""for every two key frames, there are four not-key frames,"" and no exceptions exist in the dataset?**    Thank you again for your time and help!"

"Hello! I found the following information from nuScenes website (detection, evaluation metrics, preprocessing section):  ''All boxes (GT) without lidar or radar points in them are removed. The reason is that we can not guarantee that they are actually visible in the frame. We do not filter the predicted boxes based on number of points.'' and I have 2 questions related to this:    1. For ""All boxes (GT) without lidar or radar points in them are removed."", I am not very clear about this. For example, if a box has lidar points = 2, but radar points = 0, will it be removed?   2.For ""We do not filter the predicted boxes based on number of points."", For example, if a GT box is removed, but we submit predicted box corresponding to that removed GT box, do we get punishment for a false positive, or this predicted box is ignored during evaluation?    Thank you."

"Hi,    Thanks for this great dataset. I would like to render a pointcloud using Pyrender but I'm not sure how to set the camera parameters. Pyrender uses the Opengl format (+x points right, +y points up and +z points backward). Looking at the cameras in your  , +x points right, +y points down and +z points forward. Here are a few things I would like to understand.    1. To convert the camera translation to opengl format, I multiply the y and z values by -1. Is that right?  2. Given that the camera parameters are given with respect to egoframe, that means the lidar points I would like to project need to be in the egoframe before I can project using the given camera parameters right?    Some context:  I extracted the pointcloud in the egoframe (after the third stage in  ), cropped it using the 3d bbox to obtain the pointcloud for a single person and then turned it to a mesh using trimesh's convex_hull function. I then set the camera parameters(translation, rotation(converted to rotation matrix using Quaternion(rotation).rotation_matrix), camera intrinsics(fx,fy,cx,cy) in pyrender's   but the mesh is not in the camera's view in the scene.    3. Should the rotation matrix be transposed or not when projecting in pyrender? Your projection code uses the transposed rotation matrix.    4. Is there anything I'm missing or anything else I should consider when projecting in a different system like Pyrender?    I will really appreciate your help with this.    Thank you."

"I am able to tell whether agents are moving in opposite directions, however I am not able to determine how to get in which direction a given agent is headed.     In the image below, I would like to determine the agent that is ""in-front-of"" the ego-agent (in red). However, that is relative to the direction in which the car is headed (does y coordinate increase as agent moves forward or decrease). The same would apply for left and right agents.     P.S: This is not an issue, but a discussion. I don't see a ""Discussion"" tab in this repo - may be a good idea.     !       "

"First, thanks a lot for providing the dataset and the tools.    There may a bit inconsistency in the body frame convention between the dataset and the prediction tools.  Based on the calibration files, the data are recorded with the x-axis of the body frame aligned with the heading of the car.  In the prediction tools, y-axis of the body frame is aligned with the heading of the car (such as `get_future_for_agent`)     Although it's not a big issue, it can easily lead to confusions and possibly errors.   Just want to point this out. It would be great if it can be fixed later."

"Hello, nuScenes contributors. Thank you for providing the nuscenes-devkit; it's been a great help for my research. However, there's something I need to ask about the 3D Detection Evaluation code.  ### What I've done:    - I converted the datasets to KITTI format using the `nuscenes_gt_to_kitti` presents in the **export_kitti.py**  - I run the detection and dump the result into JSON file using `kitti_res_to_nuscenes`  - I run the evaluation using the **detection/evaluate.py** script  - I tested the evaluation using **mapillary_val.json**    ### The problem:    - I found that all my boxes are filtered out due to the high **ego_dist** value (larger than the default max_dist)  - I went deeper to the code and found that the ego_dist values are calculated from the _box translation_ (x, y, z); correct me if I'm wrong  - I compared my JSON file with the one from mapillary and found that the translation difference is significant. My x and y values are 100 times smaller than the one I observed in mapillary's. I don't know how mapillary can get such values    ### Note:    - I re-run the `kitti_res_to_nuscenes` using the validation groundtruth (nuScenes -> KITTI -> JSON), and re-run the detection/evaluate.py.  - I got the similar ego_dist like mine and everything is filtered out; logically, it shouldn't be like that, right?    I'm sorry for the long question, and I hope you can provide some answer and solution. Thank you in advance."

"Hi,    I have a question regarding the size of the dataset.

"Hello,    I was trying out the prediction tutorial notebook with the following choice of layers for the static layer rasterizer:  static_layer_rasterizer = StaticLayerRasterizer(helper, layer_names=['ped_crossing', 'traffic_light'])    I looked at every 1000th instance in the training dataset and never saw any of the traffic lights, only the pedestrian crossings.    Is this because traffic lights are relatively rare in the dataset and only appear at a limited number of intersections, or is the traffic light layer not really annotated for the semantic map?  If the former, is there a good sample/instance token I could try out?    Also, am I correct in understanding that only the locations of the traffic lights are available, not their dynamic light state?    Thanks for the help!"

"A scene object has attributes `nbr_samples`, `first_sample_token` and `last_sample_token`. To access e.g. sample 15 (< `nbr_samples`), currently I iterate over the `next` sample tokens (starting at `first_sample_token`) 15 times, which requires linear time, assuming access is constant. Is there a way to see all (ordered) sample tokens linked to a scene? So I can just access the 15th one directly.

"Hi developers,    Thanks for your great work on both nuScenes & nuImages datasets.  To catch up with the release of nuImages,   just supported nuImages dataset and released Mask R-CNN/Cascade Mask R-CNN pre-trained models and their corresponding results  .    So firstly I wish you and the communities who are interested in nuScenes/nuImages know this news and try out the pre-trained models. They could not only serve as good pre-trained models but also references of the models' performance.     The second thing is a question about the implementation, especially about the class definition. The current implementation in MMDetection3D uses the same class mapping as it is in nuScenes. Thus, it maps the original about 30 categories to 10 classes and perform instance segmentation/object detection. I am not sure whether this is a suitable practice so I am seeking your opinions. So maybe this issue is also created for discussion about the implementation on nuImages dataset.    BTW, direct PRs, suggestions, and collaborations for MMDet3D are also welcomed.    Thanks."
"Thanks for the great work making all of this freely available!     While playing around with the dataset and the devkit, I noticed that the helper methods `get_past_for_agent()` and `get_past_for_sample()` return sometimes longer trajectories than expected. Here is an example of reproducing the problem with `get_past_for_agent()`:       I would expect each trajectory to have 6 or fewer timesteps (because of looking at most 3 sec into the past). However, for me, the output of the code above is 10. A similar example can be constructed for `get_past_for_sample()`. I use version 1.1.0 of the nuscenes-devkit package with Python 3.7.0 and numpy 1.19.1. I wonder whether I accidentally corrupted my data or am doing otherwise something wrong."
"Hi developers,    Thanks for the great work on nuImages. I have a question about the calibration distortion parameters.    In your documentation  , you says that   > We use the 5 parameter camera convention of the CalTech camera calibration toolbox, that is also used in OpenCV. Only for fish-eye lenses in CAM_BACK do we use the 6th parameter.    I am a little bit confused about their physical meanings, i.e., the exact mappings from the 5/6 parameters to the coefficients k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, p1, p2 in the  . As the correct order in OpenCV is `(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6]])`, should I simply treat them as from k_1 to k_5/k_6 or treat them as the first 5 or 6 parameters in the OpenCV order?    For now, I tried to undistort the image as below:     The above code works in some situations. However, when it prints `cam_distortion: [-3.01740e-01  1.38439e-01  3.31000e-04 -8.00000e-06 -4.73840e-02 7.45000e-03]`, the OpenCV throws an error as below:       So I am confused about the correct implementation, could you help me to undistort the images correctly?"

"In CoverNet's paper, it mentions    > We select a mode uniformly at random when there are no modes with an angle below the threshold.    I am wondering what is the threshold used for CoverNet or this only applies to the implementation of MTP? Also, does that mean for the loss function, we first filter out all the trajectories in the trajectory sets that have angle difference beyond the threshold and afterward calculate the best match with least L2 distance in the remaining trajectories?  Also I am wondering for the regression loss of CoverNet, does it use L1 smooth loss for positions or angles?"

"I'm working on a vehicle-only motion forecasting neural network using NuScenes, so I have outputs of X and Y coordinates taken from sample annotations, as well as the ego pose X and Y coordinates for one sample.   I'm building a visualizer tool for these outputs where I'd plot these coordinates onto a LIDAR graph. To do this, I found all the vehicle Boxes using flat coordinates for one sample.  !   The picture above shows the first box for the first vehicle in that scene, and the first row in the preds array shows the actual coordinates for that same vehicle taken from its sample annotation translation (these will be predicted coordinates eventually, I'm using the real coordinates to test if the plotting works). I plan to make copies of these boxes and replace their box.center coordinates with the coordinates I need to plot.   I assumed I could just edit find the displacement of the annotation coordinates from the ego pose coordinates but this seems to not give the same coordinates as that of box.center. How would I go about converting these coordinates from sample annotation translation to that of box.center's LIDAR coordinates? Does this have anything to do with the misalignment referenced in #197?   Thank you in advance."

"Hi!  According to _   In one annotation box there should be at least one lidar or one radar point.  However, in v1.0_mini dataset, there are 3466 empty annotation boxes, occupying 18.7% of total annotation number.  If I expand the bounding box size by 1.2x times, there are still 2925 empty annotation boxes, occupying 15.8%, if I expand the bounding box size by 1.5x times, there are still 2400 empty annotation boxes, occupying 12.9%.  These are significant amount of numbers and has conflict with the official statement.  Why this is happening?  PS. I check empty boxes both by calling API and simply searching in *.json file. Both have empty boxes."

Hi    Can you please guide on as to how to project 3d boxes to camera left and right from lidar 3d annotation. I could do it properly for camera front and back.

"Hi, thanks so much for this devkit.    I noticed that   returns (somewhat arbitrarily) the most recently created axis in the gridspec.

"Hello, thank you for the nice dataset and this devkit. I have a question regarding the rotate method in the Box class.  I want to rotate a point cloud scene with a random angle `globalRot` w.r.t Z axis, which is the vertical axis.  I first rotate the points with  `pc.rotate(Quaternion(axis=[0, 0, 1], angle=globalRot).rotation_matrix)`  and then, rotate the boxes with  `box.rotate(Quaternion(axis=[0, 0, 1], angle=globalRot))`    However, while I get the correct box coordinate, I get somehow a wrong box rotation.   Since I'm new at quaternion, I,m not sure if it makes sense what I say but suppose we have quartenion Q and R. If we want to firstly rotate a box with Q and then rotate it with R, the corresponding quartenion is RQ, which is a product of R and Q.    In the rotate method of the Box class, the definition of the box orientation is  `self.orientation =  quaternion * self.orientation`.    However, if the box first has to be rotated w.r.t `quartenion` and then w.r.t `self.orientation`, the definition should be   `self.orientation =  self.orientation * quaternion`.      Thank you!"

"Hi nuscene team,    Thanks for this great dataset.    According to paper ""nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving"", top lidar is 32-beam . So I'm guessing that's a velodyne lidar. Is that correct?    As far as I know, there are two types of 32-beam velodyne lidar, HDL-32E and 32C, where 32C have more dense beams in the middle and sparser on the boundary, while 32E have even vertical resolution. Could you please tell me the exact type of lidar that nuscene used? Thanks a lot!"

"Hi,  My question is regarding the way thresholds are calculated in the tracking evaluation.  in the function accumulate_threshold(), the recall is calculated per threshold.  the line  matches = events[events.Type == 'MATCH']  implies that only  'MATCH' event counts as true-positive event for recall calculation.  Why don't you count 'SWITCH' event as well?   I would have expect something like  matches = events[(events.Type == 'MATCH') | (events.Type == 'SWITCH')]  As a switch is also a TP event.  We can see for example, that for precision calculation, motmetrics/metrics.py uses:    def num_detections(df, num_matches, num_switches):      """"""Total number of detected objects including matches and switches.""""""      return num_matches + num_switches    Thanks a lot!"

"Hi,    Question regarding the use of Map api, I'm at the point where I have to retrieve a lot of small map patches using `map.render_map_patch()` which I then transform into numpy array and use for my experiments. The problem that I'm currently facing is that it takes hell of a lot time to retrieve these small patches in real time so my thought was that I could initially load the whole map of given city e.g. boston-seaport, transform into numpy array (lets call it `np_whole_map`) and retrieve the part of the patch that I need directly from that array which cuts the time dramatically. However, at this point I'm struggling to find a way to accurately retrieve the same part of the map that `map.render_map_patch()` would give me by accessing the `np_whole_map` e.g:    by defining the following:    `start_x = 500`   `start_y = 600`     `patch = (start_x, start_y, start_x+25, start_y+25`    the `map.render_map_patch()`  will return defined small map patch, question is, how would one retrieve that very same patch directly from `np_whole_map`?    Any suggestions how to work around it would be appreciated.     Just in addition the way I'm currently working with `np_whole_map` is that I get it using `map.render_map_patch()` where the patch defines the whole map and I set the figure size large enough so when I transform it to numpy it's roughly 10,000 x 10,000, and this is the struggle point where I cannot find an easy way to accurately retrieve the small patch defined above.

"Hi,    Just to clarify the question, we are having trouble interpreting the camera rotation from the sensor_calibration.json file, we know your data is correct but we'd appreciate having some advice from you on how to do it correctly.*    The description of our issue is the following one:    1. theoretical interpretation:  our interpretation of the situation is that in the sensor_calibration.json, all the cameras rotation and translation is given with respect to the car for every single scene, so if we plot the camera scheme for a given scene we should obtain the six cameras pointing in a different direction    2. 1st implementation:  to verify the point 1, we were using the python 'transformations' module (  to extract the yaw from every single quaternion from the 6 cameras, the result we obtained is that all the yaw values are very close to each other.    3. how we created the plot:  we used the 6 cameras rotation and translation from the scene 'cc8c0bf57f984915a77078b10eb33198' contained in sensor_calibration.json (just to make a toy implementation), then we employed the Matlab function plotCamera() and converted each quaternion to a rotation matrix using the function quat2rotm() provided by matlab, see code** and result in the attached image.      *. why are we doing this?  just to give you a context of our project.. we are trying to project 2d detections in the image canvas to the world coordinates by having a depth aproximation based on the average height of the pedestrians (we know this is not accurate, but we want to know how far we can arrive without using the lidar), but the preliminary results showed that all the pedestrians are projected to the front of the car, and during the debugging process we identified the error in our interpretation of the camera rotations.      **matlab code:    close all  clear all    scene= 'cc8c0bf57f984915a77078b10eb33198';  camera_id = '725903f5b62f56118f4094b46a4470d8';  translation =      _Originally posted by @Marel-88 in  "
"Hi, can you help me understand how can I retrieve the global coordinates starting from the output of my detection? I know the approximate depth so I can consider the distance of the object with respect to the camera, but I have trouble understanding the camera parameters about rotation, because I have seen, from a plot, that all cameras are facing the same direction unlike the nuScenes scheme presented on the web site. How should I consider rotations and translations? Aren't they given with respect to the car? This is giving me issues with my final projection. Thank you."

"Hi,    Question in regards to the use of both nuscene and the map api. I'm looking to incorporate data from the map api into my model, what I have noticed is that rendering ego pose with `render_egoposes_on_fancy_map` requires the scene token, however, if the given scene is not associated with the currently loaded map object e.g. 'boston-seaport' then it will obviously throw an exception. My question is, is there a way to identify to which map a selected scene belongs to? So that I can loop through all the scenes and pass them to the appropriate map object to retrieve the data.

How to convert the nuscenes dataset to kitti tracking fromat?
"Hi,   I've been wondering why don't we use the box.orientation.yaw_pitch_roll   Thanks in advance!"
"Hi nuscenes-devkit team,  Currently, I am trying to extract video sequence dataset from nuScenes (like kitti odometry dataset). Specifically, I would like to render image sequences where each image data has its corresponding LiDAR and radar data. My method is similar to the suggestions in #160 and #180. But I encountered some problem:    The matched LiDAR data has some inconsistent measurements on the boundary of the car. For example:  !   !   The discontinuities on LiDAR points do not match with the edge of the car. I know this might be resulted from other reasons (even bugs in my code). But I would like to double-check one possible issue:    According to the description in #160, the timestamp ""of the LIDAR scan is the time when the full rotation of the current LIDAR frame is achieved. Let delta_lidar be the time difference between two consecutive LiDAR sweeps (delta_lidar roughly equals to 1/20 s).   Then, for example, if the LiDAR scans clockwise starting from the left side and the timestamp of the LiDAR scan triggering the camera is T, the timestamp of the ""front"" camera will be around T - (3/4) * delta_lidar (because the timestamp T is the finishing time of the scan). But if we just look for the LiDAR scan with the closest timestamp to the ""front"" camera, we will actually use (T - delta_lidar) one instead of the T one (Correct me if I am wrong or the explanation is not clear).   How can I solve this problem? Can I know more details on which direction the LiDAR starts (and ends) its scanning?     Or do you have any suggestion on generating video (or say sequence) dataset from the nuScenes dataset?    Thank you in advance for any help!    Greetings,  Juan-Ting"

However, if you refer **table 1**, the radar point (represented by a blue dot) at pixel **x = 832.3** and **y = 500.1** with a **radar_id = 85** (obtained from .pcd file) shows a high velocity values v.i.z. **vx_comp = 21.267 m/s** and **vy_comp = 4.5218 m/s**, which could possibly be from the black car that is approaching the ego vehicle.    **Question 1:** Is it a known problem, could it be possible that the image and mapped radar points are not perfectly overlapping and therefore the pixels don't exactly represent radar pcs on image?    !     !     **-** According to the radar calibration, **x is front** (x coordinates in forward direction are positive) and **y is left** (y coordinates on the left side are positive) in radar coordinate system. So, taking this into consideration the y coordinates of radar point clouds lying on the left side of the ego vehicle (assuming the position of radar sensor as 0,0) should be positive and those on the right should have negative values. Likewise, after transforming the radar pointclouds to image coordinate system, **z becomes front** (positive in front) and **x becomes right** (positive on the right side). But, if you refer **table 2**, in which I have considered two points in the left half of the image plane (represented with yellow and white coloured stars). The point cloud with **radar_id = 23** is with an opposite sign convention in both the coordinate system.  Similarly, if you refer table 3, there is a similar discrepancy in radar point cloud with **radar_id = 51** in the right half of image plane (represented with cyan coloured star).    **Question 2:** Is my assumption related to the sign convention correct? If so, what could be the reason for this change in sign convention?    !     **-** This is related to velocity components, before (vx, vy) and after compensation (vx_comp, vy_comp).     **Question 3:** Is there a positive/negative direction defined for vx, vy and likewise for vx_comp and vy_comp mentioned in table 4)? Could you please explain a bit how the compensated velocities were calculated?    Best Regards,  Ajay K      "
"I realised that none of the implemented metrics in the evaluation code is sensitive to the provided height prediction in the submitted results. I actually tested this and moved all predictions 100m under the ground, and the metrics return the same values, as only the xy-position is relevant for AP and ATE and all other errors do not include position at all.    Is this intended behaviour, and when yes, with what reasoning?    If not, might I suggest including this into the ASE by aligning the prediction with the ground truth in xy-position and orientation, but not aligning in z-position, and then computing the IOU. This was actually the behaviour I expected to see, when I read the metric description, as xy-position and orientation were the only things talked about, so I assumed those were the features used for alignment."
"Thanks for the great dataset. I wanted to play around a little bit with the evaluation code so I cloned the github repo into my project and wanted to install it in editable mode using `pip install -e packages/nuscenes-devkit` as I sometimes do with other packages as well. However, in this case it did not work directly, as the `setup.py` lies in the subdir `setup`. So I change the pip-command to `pip install -e packages/nuscenes-devkit/setup`. However, on the first run, this creates a directory `python-sdk/nuscenes-devkit.egg-info` and fails, and with subsequent calls it provides a slightly different error because now this is regarded by the `setup.py` also as python package (see  ). This I fixed and the original error returns. I am not super familiar with `setuptools` and organizing Pypi packages, so I just wanted to ask, how is the intended way to get this working? I assume there is an intended way, because it works nicely from installing it directly from the Pypi repo.    Any help is appreciated."

Please correct me if the following is wrong:    Annotations are given on a sample-level, so their position in the global coordinate system belongs to the sample-timestamp X (which seems to be equal to the Lidar-sample_data-timestamp?!).  Say you use render_sample_data() for CAM_FRONT, then boxes made from annotations with timestamp X are transformed to the sensor coordinate system by using the ego_pose of the specific sample_data and therefore timestamp Y (because CAM_FRONT data has a different timestamp as the sample).

"Hi, I found there are some mistakes about point cloud axis.    1. In `data_classes.py` line 249, the return of  function `from_file` should be (x, z, y, intensity). The order of y and z is wrong.   I found this problem by ploting a 3D scatter plot. Also, if you watch the range of `pc.points`, you will find the range of `pc.points[0, :]` and `pc.points[2, :]` is similar and the range of `pc.points[1, :]` is very different from them. For these reasons, I think `pc.points[1, :]` is z axis, which means height.    2. In `nuscenes.py` line 550, it should be `y axis` instead of `z axis` in th comment.   (line 551 is right, because `pc.points[2, :]` is y axis which is also means depth.)    3. In `nuscenes.py` line 554, it should be `coloring = pc.points[1, :]`, because the depth is `pc.points[1, :]`, not `pc.points[2, :]`.  (It is apparent that there is a contradiction between line 551 and line 554, because depth is y axis and height is z axis. It not should be both use `pc.points[2, :]`)    4. It you modify codes as I said and run `render_pointcloud_in_image` again, you will find the output image with point clouds is more reasonable.    5. If my finds are right, I'm afraid that they will have an influence of other functions like `view_points` or the radar data may have the same mistakes.    Thanks!"

The images and annotations are the same (occasionally additional annotations).     e.g sample 343 and sample 369  (the camera keys point to the same filenames)    This issue extends from samples 343 -357 which are the same as these samples: 369-383    Was this intentional? If so, why?    Thank you.        "
"Hello,     I want to compute the homography matrix from the ground plane to the camera plane. To do so, I use the following matrix:  H = K * T * R * A   where K is the intrinsic matrix, T the translation matrix, R the rotation matrix and A the 3d to 2d projection matrix.   I got wrong results until I tweaked the values setting the focal length to a third of its value and setting the translation to values that do not correspond to the ones given. I know I am doing something wrong because your projection works perfectly fine when projecting the Lidar in the camera plane.     Can you give me an idea of what could be possibly wrong in my approach.   Many thanks. "
"Hi,  Need some help on how to set up nu-scenes in windows (I am stuck for several weeks ):  I have installed python 3.7 through anaconda prompt   I have installed the packages from the requirements.txt  Completed the data download (meta, point_samples, point_sweep, image_samples, image_sweep, dev-kit)    From this point how to proceed further ?  Have tried working the solution by going through the existing reported issues but no luck so far.  will appreciate a lot if somebody can help.  I am a beginner in python."
"as I am working on collision avoidance paper I would like to get the true data ie,  x,y,z co-ordinates for all the scenes available could you help me out with the same."
"Hello,   Do you provide a 2D bounding box of the detected objects (xy coordinates in pixels)?   I saw that _view points_ in _geometry utils.py_ allows to project the corners of the 3d bounding box into the image plane. However, projecting those corners (e.g all the 8 corners or only the frontal ones) does not match exactly a 2D bounding box, depending on the position of the instance in the image.     Thank you"
"Hi,     Could you please share the following specification:  1- Radars Vertical and horizontal resolution and FOV  2- Cameras FOV    Best Regards,  "
"The documentation doesn't discuss how samples are created. The `nusc` object contains 3,977 samples. Assuming they are taken at 2Hz (the same frequency as the labels, as mentioned in the dataset overview), the total number of seconds in the sample records, as computed in a modified `list_scenes` function, should be equivalent to 3,977 / 2. However, I got `total length: 1931.2375695705414` -> `3862 != 3977`. Here is the modified `list_scenes()` function I used to compute the length. The 13 second overlap as mentioned in #8 is not enough to account for the discrepancy. How are the extra samples created?        "
Bug on the following line?   
"`eval_utils.attr_acc()` will return `np.nan` for classes without attributes (e.g. _barrier_).    This will eventually lead to `assert np.nanmin(metric_vals) >= 0` failing when `tp_metrics()` is run for the `barrier` class.    Thus, the `nuscenes_eval` script will always crash, I believe. Haven't checked the code thoroughly but I think that is the case.."
"I want to try the `nuscenes_eval.py` script with fake results. I.e. there might be 0 TPs in the results file.     In this case the `assert np.nanmin(metric_vals) >= 0` fails, since `metric_vals` contains only `np.nan`. Took me a while to understand why.    How about adding an error message to the `assert` statement?  Or should the case of 0 TPs be handled in another way?"
"what is the parameter for setting the threshold value for the bounding boxes. By default it is set to BoxVisibility.ANY, how can i change this to make bounding boxes when visibility is greater the 70%?    Thanks in advance."
       Typo? should be `dict`?

Do we have access to the IMU measurements such as the velocity and acceleration of the ego vehicle? Or do we obtain them by deriving the vehicle's translation with respect to time? 
"Hi,   Is there semantic segmentation for lidar points in the sample data and is there an example of how to use it?  Thank you"
" Hello,    For every annotation, the object Box returns the orientation of the bounding box in degrees:    **filename, boxes, kk = nusc.get_sample_data(token_sd, box_vis_level=0)  for box in boxes:      angle= box.orientation.degrees**    Can you please clarify what the angle refers to? I expected the angle to be the orientation in the XZ plane of the bounding box with respect to the camera. However, people facing the camera sometimes have positive angles, sometimes negative angles.     In general, how can I obtain the orientation of the bounding box with respect to the camera?    Thank you very much  Lorenzo"
