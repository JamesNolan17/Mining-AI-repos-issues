2. `issueDB.csv`: For every repository in `repoDB.csv`, we fetched all issues (both open issues and closed issues) under it. The mapping relationship between `issueDB.csv` and `repoDB.csv` are:

   **issue i in repo r** : `i[Name_Repo] == r[Name_Repo] & i[Identity_Repo] in r[IDList_Issue]`

   A cross check between these 2 DBs are conducted to ensure the integrity of them.
